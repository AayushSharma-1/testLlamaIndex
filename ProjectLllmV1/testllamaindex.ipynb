Completed in 2008 at an estimated cost of seven billion rupees, the site spans more than twenty-five acres and is enclosed by a vedika-like fence.[44] It is located at the bottom of a hill, next to the Gomti river and beside a flyover, a strategic location that ensures its visibility. The vast, open, granite-lined courts, which are kept scrupulously clean; prominent ticket booths; and monumental entrance gates invite visitors inside. As they travel through, visitors can read about each structure, figures depicted in the statues, and the BSP, and gaze at images of Mayawati inaugurating the complex in the brochures that are given with the entrance tickets.\\n\\nThere is also an open-air sculpture gallery, whose walls are adorned with high-relief bronze narrative friezes depicting key events from the political careers of Kanshi Ram and Mayawati. In one, they stand side by side on a stage as Kanshi Ram addresses the assembled, cheering, flag-waving crowd. The accompanying Hindi inscription informs viewers that on December 15, 2001, at Lakshman Mela Ground in Lucknow, Kanshi Ram, the founder of the BSP, named Mayawati as his successor (see fig. 5). Another frieze depicts Mayawati feeding cake to a convalescing Kanshi Ram; the inscription states that this happened on the occasion of his seventieth birthday at Batra Hospital in Delhi (fig. 8). The figures are flanked by plants and diminutive statues of the Buddha, again associating Kanshi Ram and Mayawati with Ambedkar and the faith adopted by so many of their community members.\\nThese friezes establish a highly personal, parental relationship between Kanshi Ram and Mayawati. The frieze depicting the rally maps Mayawati’s inheritance of Kanshi Ram’s charisma via his designation, while the frieze of her feeding him suggests that she received his charisma via hereditary descent. Significantly, during Jayalalitha’s campaign for office in the early 1990s, she commissioned cutouts and banners that placed her next to her political mentor, the much-loved Tamil politician, MGR, whose promotion of Jayalaltiha’s career paralleled Kanshi Ram’s promotion of Mayawati. During her campaign, Jayalalitha was depicted attending to MGR like a dutiful daughter, again mapping the transference of charisma from one political generation to the next.[45] It is also worth noting that it remains difficult for women to rise to positions of political authority in South Asia. Thus, nearly all female politicians are initiated into politics by elder male relatives, particularly husbands or fathers. Mayawati and Jayalalitha are notable exceptions, and both use public art to create necessary fictive lineages from their male mentors.\\n\\nThe high degree of detail and photorealism displayed by the friezes and their brief, concise text recall photographs and their text captions in newspapers. If, as Roland Barthes argues, a photograph operates as a “certificate of presence,” proving that what it depicts happened and who it depicts existed,[46] newspaper photographs and their captions are ultimate certificates of presence. Mayawati, whose political and personal life is so frequently the subject of media scrutiny, is surely aware of the power of this form of presentation for its believability. The newspaper format allows her to convey in the most convincing format that certain events occurred and that others did not. The presentation of Mayawati as a nurturing, attentive child who feeds her enfeebled, yet smiling father was probably intended to convey an additional message about the nature of their relationship. Several high-ranking male members of the BSP have publically accused Mayawati of wielding undue influence over Kanshi Ram and holding him hostage in her house after his stroke.[47] The newspaper-photograph-like presentation of the frieze showing her feeding him “proves” otherwise.\\n\\nThe Ambedkar Memorial is dominated by a monumental stupā, measuring approximately two hundred feet in height. As with the pillars and vedekās, the Ambedkar stupā appropriates from, but is not a copy of, any specific Indian monument. The most striking difference between the Great Stupa at Sanchi, and the Ambedkar stupā is that while the former is comprised of solid hemispherical masses that cannot be entered, the latter is architectural, with a domed central chamber. The Ambedkar stupā’s four prominent directional entrances create an imposing, palatial structure. They are accessed by monumental staircases arranged in the form of a lotus blossom, a prominent symbol in Buddhist art.[48] Significantly, the only way to view the stupā’s lotus plan is from the air, which is Mayawati’s exclusive vantage point.\\n\\nThe exterior of the Ambedkar stupā references a glorious ancient dalit past through the appropriation of ancient Indian stupā form and decoration, including blind chandrashala arches (see fig. 7), a monumental chandrashala-arched entrance, and a harmikā (square planned fence on top of stupās). The stupā form has additional, more immediate significance for the dalit community, beyond its antiquity: Ambedkar was cremated and his ashes interred in the Chaitya Bhoomi stupā at Dadar Choupati, Mumbai.\\n\\nThe interior of the Ambedkar stupā is dominated by a twenty-seven-foot-high bronze statue in the round of a seated Ambedkar (fig. 9). Inscribed at the base of the sculpture is the phrase, “My life struggle is my message.” Ambedkar never said this; Mayawati devised the phrase, considering it more appropriate than his more famous, somewhat militant galvanizing slogan, “Educate, Organize, Agitate!”[49] Mayawati’s phrase likely is also a rebuttal to the popular Gandhian phrase, “My life is my message.” Here, the emphasis is on how Ambedkar struggled and overcame (more so than Gandhi), thereby providing a communal model.\\n\\nMayawati intended the Ambedkar statue to be modeled on the sculpture of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.[50] The reference is apt. Ambedkar, who was a lawyer, wrote the Indian constitution, and Lincoln, also a lawyer, amended the American constitution to extend rights to all (male) citizens, including African Americans, after the Civil War. Ambedkar frequently likened Indian dalits to African Americans and viewed Lincoln as a champion of the rights of the subalterns in his own nation. Mayawati herself received her LLB and is also an admirer of Lincoln; she sought to link the founder of her movement to a well-known international figure and make the dalits’ struggle universal.\\n\\nThe central statue is ringed by high-relief bronze friezes on the surrounding walls that depict key events from Ambedkar’s life. In one, he sits at a desk, pen in hand, writing the constitution (fig. 10). He is flanked by a map of India, over which is inscribed “Bharat,” and a table bearing a Buddha statue and an Ashokan lion capital, which Ambedkar and Nehru promoted as the national icon of independent India. If the iconography is unclear, a Hindi inscription informs the viewer of the events depicted. In another frieze, the viewer is again informed in text and image that Ambedkar is presenting the constitution to President Rajendra Prasad (fig. 11). They are surmounted by the Ashokan lion capital and the circular-planned Indian Parliament House, which crowns the three figures like an honorific umbrella. The bronze friezes within the stupā also reference Ambedkar’s religious conversion. Wearing monastic robes, Ambedkar stands next to an enshrined image of the Buddha with a monk on the other side (fig. 12). The accompanying inscription informs us that in Nagpur, on October 14, 1956, Ambedkar converted to Buddhism.\\nMoving in a clockwise direction—the established direction for progressing in Buddhist monuments and thus the logical direction in the Ambedkar stupā—the penultimate frieze offers an aerial view of the sprawling memorial complex (the way Mayawati would view the site from her helicopter), with inscriptions naming each structure. An eleven-foot sculpture in the round of Mayawati stands beside the frieze, emphasizing her role as patron. The cycle concludes with eleven-foot sculptures in the round of Mayawati and Kanshi Ram that flank and gesture toward a bronze frieze of the Ambedkar sculpture enshrined within the stupā (see fig. 4). The inscriptions inform us that Sushrī (Most Honorable) Mayawati, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, laid the foundation for the stupā on August 15, 1995. In publically laying the memorial’s foundation, Mayawati was again participating in an established expression of her charisma, in what Sara Dickey terms Indian “person-centered politics.” Participating in public cornerstone-laying ceremonies amid much fanfare is a common means by which an Indian politician spreads awareness of his or her “person.” [51] The date of the ceremony is also significant, as it was the anniversary of both Ambedkar’s birthday and Indian Independence Day during Mayawati’s first year in office.\\n\\nThe centrally located Ambedkar statue and the friezes highlight Ambedkar’s various achievements. Ultimately, they link him to Mayawati, whose agency in the construction of the very site in which all these sculptures are housed, is underscored at the end of the cycle. Mayawati stands with Kanshi Ram by the bronze frieze depicting the Ambedkar statue, thereby visually mapping the lineage of dalit political power from Ambedkar to Kanshi Ram and finally to herself.\\n\\nMayawati also uses the Ambedkar stupā as a stage for performing her political lineage from Ambedkar. In addition to commencing construction at the site on Ambedkar’s birthday and personally laying its foundation stone, Mayawati annually holds ceremonies for Ambedkar’s birthday at the complex. During these events, Mayawati, who is accompanied by throngs of party officials, Buddhist monks, and constituents from throughout the state, publically garlands the main Ambedkar statue and delivers speeches before it.\\nBuilt between 2003 and 2005, the Prerna Kendra is a very different type of structure. The Ambedkar Memorial is open, sprawling, and of a monumental scale. By contrast, the far smaller Prerna Kendra is woven into the dense urban fabric of upper-middle-class apartments and shops in a residential area across Lucknow. With its high, battered surrounding walls, which block visibility from the street, and discreet entrance, the Prerna Kendra is evocative of a fortress. The form of the Ambedkar stupā is based on ancient Indian stupās. The formal inspiration for the 105-foot-tall steep pyramidal Prerna Kendra was another well-known Buddhist pilgrimage site, the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya. The most important Buddhist pilgrimage site, the temple marks the site of the Buddha’s enlightenment, again linking dalits to their Buddhist past and a wider international Buddhist community.\\n\\nThe intended audiences of the Ambedkar Memorial and the Prerna Kendra are also different. With its entrance fees and well-run infrastructure, the Ambedkar Memorial was intended as public space for members of the upper and middle castes as well as dalits; there Mayawati broadcasts versions of dalit history, the achievements of her community members, and her own charisma to the widest possible audience. The Prerna Kendra’s entrance is discreet, the building’s form is largely obscured by its high outer walls, and the site is frequently closed. It is therefore far less inviting to non-community members.[53]\\n\\nMayawati inaugurated the Prerna Kandra in 2005 during a Buddhist ritual performed by monks. Media coverage of the event noted her benevolence to the monks; she gave them large sums of money, fruit, and umbrellas.[54] In demonstrating such largesse, she again used her architectural commission as a stage to perform her political legitimacy. Not only did she ally with the Buddhist monks, most of whom are former dalits, she reminded all that the faith is deeply associated with dalit activism. Moreover, in showing such magnanimity, Mayawati was subscribing to a well-established tradition in Indian rulership: generous support of religious organizations and their monastic members.\\nInscriptions on a pyramidal marble block on the ground floor offer excerpts from Kanshi Ram’s will that state he wanted Mayawati to light his pyre and his ashes to be enshrined in the Prerna Kandra. The will also specifies that Kanshi Ram wanted Mayawati’s cremated remains to be enshrined at the site, which will thus transform the Prerna Kendra into a political, dynastic funerary memorial.\\n\\nIn weaving prominent dalit memorials into a land that had denied the community a presence in space, Mayawati demanded to be recognized. Weaving dalit corporeal remains into Lucknow’s urban fabric was an even more assertive gesture. Her sculptural and architectural memorials suggest permanence and, by extension, the irreversible betterment of her community. By interring their ashes in the Prerna Kandra, Kanshi Ram and Mayawati themselves are symbolically eternally present and are always leading their community toward an ever better future. Mayawati was voted out of office in early 2012, but her successor Akhilesh Yadav has affirmed that the new government will not disturb the dalit memorials. This is hardly surprising, given that Mayawati vowed on several occasions that there would be major dalit protests and communal unrest if her memorials were destroyed.[55] Her threat was put to the test immediately after her and Ambedkar’s statues were vandalized; as she had predicted, her community members retaliated by peacefully demonstrating and blocking roads in Lucknow. Images have power, and Mayawati intends to ensure that their messages will be heard for as long as possible.\\n\\nKanshi Ram and Mayawati surely would have been aware of the long history and potentially legitimizing messages of funerary memorials in India. In addition to stupās, there are several other types of South Asian funerary memorials. In Islamic India, rulers commissioned lavish, monumental tombs for their late fathers. The formal and decorative programs and construction materials of the Indo-Islamic tombs helped their royal patrons project their own public identities.[56] Rajput and Maratha kings similarly memorialized their predecessors through cenotaphs (chatrīs) with politically charged forms and decoration.[57] By installing Kanshi Ram’s ashes in the Prerna Kendra, Mayawati appropriated an established royal Indic practice of architectural memorialization. Similar to performing a father’s funerary rites, commissioning his memorial is a legitimizing act in India that irrefutably establishes dynastic lineage and the transference of political authority from one generation to the next. Thus, in the Indic context, a funerary memorial is an index not only of absence (of the memorialized deceased) but also of presence and legitimate power (of the memorial’s heir and patron).\\n\\nLike those of many other notable examples of Indian funerary architecture, the Prerna Kendra’s ultimate message appears to refer more to its patron than the one memorialized. Perhaps even more than the Ambedkar stupā, the sculptural program at the Prerna Kendra asserts Mayawati’s charisma and ability to lead her party. As noted in a lengthy inscription at the site, the urn with Kanshi Ram’s cremated ashes is contained in a marble plinth located in the center of the main chamber on the second floor. The plinth supports three bronze monumental statues in the round. A life-sized Ambedkar is elevated above flanking eighteen-foot statues of Kanshi Ram and Mayawati. The triangular composition, with Ambedkar’s raised position, once again visually reiterates the lineage of charismatic leadership in dalit politics.\\n\\nThe walls of the Prerna Kendra’s chambers, which are spread over three floors, are lined with bronze friezes that feature episodes from Mayawati’s life, with an emphasis on major events in her political career. Over the three levels of the Prerna Kendra, the friezes’ narrative unfolds in a clockwise direction. Mayawati first appears, uncharacteristically in a sari, on a frieze with an inscription noting that it marks her fiftieth birthday and wishing her congratulations. She then appears with her family in a group portrait as a child (fig. 13); she studies for her exams with a Buddha image on her bookshelf; she is sworn in as chief minister (fig. 14); she dines with high-ranking members of government while in close conversation and laughing (fig. 15), clearly accepted by and completely at ease in these circles of power. The friezes also depict Mayawati’s major architectural commissions, again calling attention to her prolific building activity, which has made dalit public presence conspicuous, material, and permanent.\\nDespite the fact that the Prerna Kendra houses his ashes, Kanshi Ram himself makes few appearances in its friezes. When he is depicted, it is during key events that validate Mayawati’s political power: when he publically declared her as his successor, and when she cared for him during his illness as if she were his child. In fact, Kanshi Ram appears most frequently in the friezes as a corpse and as cremated ashes. Mayawati first mourns over her mentor’s corpse, she lights his pyre, she places the cremated ashes on an altar before the Buddha and finally in the Prerna Kendra (figs. 16, 17). The funerary friezes all carefully record in Hindi that Kanshi Ram’s last rites were done in accordance with his wishes.\\nThe final frieze in the program presents Mayawati in one of her most controversial and well-documented performances of charismatic authority (fig. 18). She is well known and frequently criticized for allowing herself to be festooned with colossal garlands made from countless one thousand rupee notes. Each garland has an estimated value of between $500,000 to $2 million. Since 2010, Mayawati has accepted these money garlands, which the BSP claims represent donations from party members, at public events like political rallies and celebrations of Kanshi Ram’s birthday.[58] In what have become iconic media images, she appears flanked by aides who hoist the cumbersome money garland over her shoulders. Mayawati raises one arm and holds her hand in a gesture that parallels the one displayed by the Ambedkar statues she commissions, again visually linking these two political figures.\\n\\nMayawati’s detractors sharply criticize such performances as vulgar and inappropriate, particularly because she claims to represent the poorest and most disadvantaged members of Indian society. Moreover, when she accepted the garlands, she was chief minister of one of the poorest states in the nation. Mayawati herself has remained silent on the subject of the money garlands. However, it is worth considering that, because dalits historically have been denied access to vast sums of money and political authority, their chosen representative’s conspicuous display of both undeniably announces their assertion of their power and defiance in the face of criticism.\\n\\nIn her performances of such conspicuous displays of wealth Mayawati again draws from models of ancient Indic kingship, which are being revived by democratically elected politicians. Weber observed followers’ donations of large sums of cash and luxury items as recognition of their leaders’ charisma.[59] Beyond signifying Mayawati’s wealth and charismatic authority, the money garlands are metonyms that signify the prosperity her community members may now legitimately claim through her leadership. In models of traditional Indic kingship, the ruler’s body and his state were to an extent conflated. It was therefore a royal responsibility to appear in public “in the beauty and dazzle of his person,”[60] to amass wealth, and stage awesome performances of conspicuous consumption to convey the well-being of the state. Established in ancient India, royal acts of conspicuous displays of wealth continued to hold currency into the colonial period. The practice is enjoying a resurgence under Jayalalitha[61] and Mayawati. Indian media frequently covers the spectacular decorations and gifts Jayalalitha’s supporters bestow upon her during public appearances: her route to the venue is bedecked with illuminated triumphal arches, her footpath strewn with flowers and the air perfumed. After mounting a lavishly decorated stage, she is given gold coins, reminiscent of performances of support by subjects to their kings, and a silver-plated scepter, a traditional symbol of kingship in India.[62] Mayawati has claimed that she amasses her personal wealth on behalf of her community, making her ostentatious displays of wealth symbols of dalit pride and empowerment.[63]\\n\\nThat the frieze cycle at the Prerna Kendra concludes with this iconic image of Mayawati’s power, wealth, and charisma is fitting. As with the statues and friezes in the Ambedkar stupā, those in the Prerna Kendra laud the achievements of previous dalit leaders and activists, but ultimately map a trajectory to Mayawati as their rightful heir. Her money garlands announce her charisma and the upward mobility she secures for her community. As with other aspects of her commissions—scale, semantic content of the inscriptions, durability of materials, and overall cost—her money-garland frieze surpasses its models.\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The word \\'chikan\\' means embroidery, and this form of art incorporates 36 different stitching techniques. In the beginning, only white yarn or muslin cloth was used. Stitching is done on the back of the cloth whereas the design is made on the front by tiny, running stitches. There are three main types of stitches – flat, embossed, and jaali (net effect). Due to a Persian influence, flowers have a permanent place in this art form. Typical chikankari motifs include creepers and vines. However, the types and styles in which these flowers are made keep varying with fashion trends. Today, there are hundreds of retailers of chikankari fabric across the country. In Lucknow, the lanes of markets are dotted with shops selling chikan work in various forms. You can pick up shirts, kurtas, bedsheets, table cloth, pillow covers and many other items adorned in chikankari. \\n\\nThe technique is supposed to have been introduced by Mughal empress, Nur Jahan, in the 17th century.  Another legend speaks of a thirsty traveller, who stopped at a village in Lucknow, and requested a villager for water. Humbled by the villager’s hospitality and generosity, he imparted the skill of chikankari to him as an act of gratitude. \\nZardozi\\nThis signature embroidery art of Lucknow has been around for centuries and has been been accorded a Geographical Indication tag (GI). Lucknow is the primary centre for zardozi, and apparels featuring this embroidery can be found in well-known shops of Chowk area, as well as other bazaars in the city. In Persian, \\'zardozi\\' means gold embroidery. \\n\\nThe original process, which is known as “Kalabatun”, made use of silk threads wrapped in real gold or silver; the thread was subsequently sewn onto different fabrics, and then embellished with gold threads, spangles, seed pearls, wires, beads, sequins etc. In the times of the nawabs, zardozi was used to decorate tapestries and wall hangings. Even elephants and horses were covered with heavy cloths adorned with zardozi. In that era, this form of embroidery was considered a luxury, since it could only be done on heavier fabrics like velvet, satin and silk. Therefore, only the royalty could afford it. It was regarded as a symbol of opulence. \\nPerfumes/Attar\\nThe city of Lucknow is known for its fine perfumes that are available in beautiful bottles of cut-glass work. Perfumers in Lucknow make delicate and lasting fragrances using various aromatic herbs, spices, sandal oil, musk, essence of flowers, and leaves. Attar, derived from Persian word \\'atr\\' means fragrance. Perfumes or attars have been in use in Lucknow since the 19th century. During the days of the nawabs, perfumes were also added to food to enhance the taste and aroma of the dish. It is said that Mughal empress, Nur Jahan, would bathe in water perfumed by rose water, thus encouraging people to start extracting scented oil from the flower. \\n\\nLegend has it that the practice of using natural substances to derive scents came from ascetics who would burn roots and other plant material during their meditative bonfires. The sweet smells lingered for a while, inspiring nearby villagers to experiment with flowers to find the right tones. Once they had attars down to a science, the villagers started presenting these fragrances to the nawabs, who would spray the halls and walkways of the palaces before the arrival of guests. Since attar also has therapeutic properties, when sprayed in public spaces, it would subtly put visitors at ease.  \\nSurrounded by terraced lawns and gardens, the Residency, overlooking River Gomti, is one of the oldest buildings in the city. Originally, it was built as a large complex of residential quarters, armoury, stables, dispensaries, worship places, for the British General, a representative of the British East India Company, during the rule of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan between 1780 and 1800. Today, the ruins of the building reflect its former glory and allow one to soak in its colonial charm while visiting. The Baillie guard gate, named after Residency’s first resident, Col John Baillie, gives you a glimpse of the architecture and design you will see inside. The treasury, which was completely destroyed during the sepoy mutiny of 1857, and a marble plaque honouring the brave soldiers of that time, are the two structures you will see as you walk towards the main buildings. The banquet hall, still bearing intricate carvings and featuring high ceilings, with a pretty fountain in the centre, will transport you back to the time of grand ballroom dances and opulent parties. Opposite the hall stands Dr Fayrer’s (resident surgeon) house, used as a shelter for the British during the mutiny, as well as a makeshift hospital.\\n\\nTranslating to martyrs\\' memorial, Shaheed Smarak is a white marble structure standing amidst a beautiful park. It was built in 1970 by the Lucknow Development Authority on the banks of River Gomti opposite the Residency, in order to commemorate hundreds of soldiers who lost their lives during the 1857 freedom movement of India. The monument was designed and conceptualised by celebrated architect Prasanna Kothari, and emulates the style of Amar Jawan Jyoti, located at the India Gate in New Delhi, which also pays tribute to the thousands of jawaans who gave up their lives for the security of the nation. You can pay your respect to those who sacrificed their lives for the country, and spend some time exploring the vast grounds while stealing a moment of peace and serenity. \\nCharbagh Railway Station, one of the two main railway stations in Lucknow, is an architectural marvel that features the best of Rajasthani and Mughal styles, mixed with British influences.

Such is the ingenuity of the construction that large water reservoirs are beautifully hidden inside the building. Charbagh was designed by JH Horniman, an Englishman, in 1914. \\n\\nBara Imambara is perhaps the most recognisable and popular symbol of Lucknow, and is visited by thousands of tourists all year round. \\n\\nBuilt as a relief project to provide work to the people of Awadh during a famine, the Bara Imambara was constructed by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula during the 18th century, and its name essentially translates to a big place of worship. Its architecture, with delicate arches and jharokhas (windows), boasts Rajput, Mughal and Gothic influences. \\n\\nThere are two main entrances to the Imambara, both guarded by enormous gateways. The ceiling of its central hall is said to have used interlocking bricks without any beams or pillars for support. The structure has an amazing maze of corridors called \\'bhul bhulaiya\\'. It has a network of more than 1,000 labyrinthine passages with some leading to entrance or exit points and others heading to deadends. There are also 489 doorways standing at the mouths of confusing, twisting paths. The grave of the nawab is located under a canopy. At one time, there was a mile-long tunnel underground running to River Gomti that added mysticism to the location. \\n\\nSurrounding the main edifice are lush, well-maintained gardens that are perfect for a leisurely stroll, or for just relaxing and soaking in the splendour of the Bara Imambara.\\n\\nLucknow is full of stellar examples of Nawabi architecture, but there are few that compare to the Chhota Imambara, built by Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah in 1838.

The Chhota Imambara boasts a gilded dome, several turrets and beautiful chandeliers. It comprises five doorways and Islamic verses have been carved into its exterior walls. There are two main halls, namely Shenasheen and Azakhana. The latter is embellished with gilt-edged mirrors and colourful stuccos, as well as exquisite chandeliers that are said to have been brought from Belgium. It is because of these lamps and crystal chandeliers that this iconic building is also known as the palace of lights. \\n\\nThe Imambara stands to the west of the Bara Imambara, with the exterior of the building boasting a golden dome with fine calligraphy. It is at its finest during festivals and other special occasions, when the whole structure is lit up and glimmers like a jewel.\\n\\nShahnajaf Imambara is a white-domed mausoleum constructed by Nawaz Ghazi-ud-din Haider at Paltan Ghat. He was the last wazir (minister) and the first king of the state of Awadh in 1816-1817, and has been buried at Shahnajaf, which is why this Imambara is also known as Karbala. His wives, Mubarak Mahal, Sarfaraz Mahal and Mumtaz Mahal, are also buried here. The Imambara was a tribute and symbol of his devotion to Caliph Hazrat Ali, the husband of Fatima, who is said to be the favourite daughter of Prophet Mohammed.\\n\\nThis Saturn-shaped building is situated at Surajkund Park and is a major attraction of the city. The planetarium boasts a state-of-the-art projection system that is renowned for special effects that thrill children and adults alike.

They say that’s the reason why more and more activities celebrating Hindi literature are being organised in the city. However, some caution that absence of money for writers, thinkers and poets could hurt the prospects of Hindi literature in Lucknow.\\n\\nIn this era when people prefer reading books on the internet, Lucknow writers are coming out with more and more books in Hindi on a variety of subjects,” said poet and Hindi literature critic Sarvesh Asthana.\\n\\n“Books of four eminent comic poets will be released at the same event at the Sangeet Natak Akademi here on ‘Hindi Diwas’. These include Mukul Mahan’s ‘Yamlok Mein Ghotala’, Rajendra Pandit’s ‘Pandit Ji’, Pankaj Prasoon’s ‘Lampatganj’ and my book ‘Wo Balkani Wali’.

Every state has its own unique art of pottery making be it the “Blue Pottery” of Rajasthan, the “Terracotta” of Madhya Pradesh or the “Chinhat Pottery” of Uttar Pradesh. Every form of pottery is uniquely creative and unequivocally beautiful as it involves great deal of art, skill and craft of the potter who gives exquisite shapes and designs to a mere handful of clay.\\n\\nLucknow city, famous for its rich culture and heritage, has another creative dimension to it in the form of Chinhat pottery. The form of pottery, named after the place where it is mainly practised, has added to the already rich pool of indigenous and ingenious craft of the city.\\n\\nChinhat Pottery is mainly done in the Chinhat area which lies at the eastern outskirts of the Lucknow city, on Faizabad Road. The place has emerged as a famous hub for pottery in the Uttar Pradesh state, and has attracted tourists as well. Chinhat pottery is a beautiful and creative art of handicraft that has life added at the hands of the native potters skilled in the art of pottery-making.\\n\\nPicture of pottery items on display at Chinhat, Lucknow. \\n\\nLucknow and the Chinhat Pottery\\n\\nThe city of Nawabs has been the centre of art and craft since ages. Lucknow city carries a rich legacy of creativity and culture behind. Right from chikankari and zardozi, to pottery-making, Lucknow has been a thriving ground for the local skill and craftsmanship.\\n\\nLucknow has a long standing history of pottery-making since the time it was ruled by the Mughals and Nawabs. The basic form of pottery-making in the city was all about the coating of the bases of the tanks with clay, which went on to include the making of colourful figures of different races on these tanks. It also involved carving of fruits of clay, a form of pottery that is still prevalent at large, in the city.\\n\\nWith the origination of the craft at Chinhat, the art of pottery-making in Lucknow thrived and still continues to serve as a source of bread and butter for a large number of potters. In fact, the close proximity of Lucknow helps in acting as a good market for the finished products. Pottery-making emerged as a lucrative industry with the recent trend of using pottery for beautification of landscapes in hospitality industry and house interiors too. However, today, the once prosperous trade looks desperate for an immediate overhaul and stimulus for better future of both the potters and the business as a whole.\\n\\nHow it all started in Chinhat?\\n\\nChinhat used to be a small hamlet on the outskirts of Lucknow, along the Lucknow- Barabanki road. Chinhat gained popularity due to the commencement of pottery-making industry Picture of pottery shop at chinhat, Lucknow. Captured by lucknowpulse team.that helped the village secure an important position as a pottery-making hub in the state.\\n\\nThe craft of pottery making is very old and started with the pilot project that was launched by the Planning Research and Action Institute (PRAI) of the State Planning Department. The pilot project was launched in the year 1957 with a two-fold objective of training the unemployed youth of the area in pottery making and to establish small units to be managed and controlled by the learners themselves. The local people of Chinhat saw potential of making it big and profitable in the field of pottery-making with the help of this project. The institute received 5000 applications and soon the efforts started bearing fruits of success. The products were received well both in the national and international market.\\n\\nThe PRAI also developed a kiln in Chinhat to further the cause of developing the pottery-making industry. The craft also received support from the U.P Small Industries Corporation (UPSIC). UPSIC made the entire work procedure more organized and provided support to the entrepreneurs to develop the pottery-making industry in Chinhat.\\n\\nWhat all they make?\\n\\nChinhat pottery comes under the category of Glazed Terracotta pottery and Ceramics. The pottery has a rustic look to it and carries an earthen appearance. The glazes are usually green and brown-coloured while the designs are put on the usual white and cream bases. The firing of the Chinhat pottery is done at 1180 to 1200 celsius. The products include mugs, bowls, vases, cups and saucers. The blue on white, toy tea-sets from Chinhat are also very popular apart from the mugs, flower vases, and the leaf-shaped plates. The designs are at times in geometric shapes and the final products are beautiful pieces of creativity, skill and hard work put together by the potters of Chinhat.\\n\\nPicture of a potter at work in Lucknow\\'s Chinhat.\\n\\nFor potters, pottery-making is not just an occupation to earn livelihood, it is their work which they worship. However, the recent spurt in the availability of cheap Chinese products in the markets and ignorance of the authorities has caused trouble for the potters. The industry still has huge potential of turning into a big profitable business for the state. But, efforts need to be stepped up to promote the craft at both national and international levels as it holds a great potential for both Lucknow city as well as the local craftsmen.\\n\\nDo find a chance to visit the exquisite Chinhat pottery village on your trip to Lucknow to be able to have the real feel of the whole process of pottery-making. You may also indulge in some shopping for your house if you like the pottery art native to Lucknow, the city of Nawabs.\\n\\nLucknow city, known for its rich heritage, mannerisms and the Nawabi culture has another dimension added to it in the type of Chinhat pottery. This is named after the location where it primarily originated and had put into the already abundant pool of ingenious and indigenous craft of the city.\\n\\nChinhat Pottery was primarily produced in the Chinhat region which is at the eastern outskirts of the Lucknow city, on the Faizabad Road. Chinhat had emerged as a popular hub for pottery in the Uttar Pradesh back in the 1970’s and the terracotta industry was already thriving there for a long time.\\n\\nChinhat attracted visitors not only from India but from all over the world. Chinhat pottery is a creative and beautiful art form of handcrafted pottery which generated bread and butter for the local craftsmen. For the potters there, pottery making was not just an occupation to generate a livelihood, it was the work of theirs which they worshipped.\\n\\nThe beauty of the Chinhat pottery faded away because of the apathy from both the Central and the state government as well as the competition from pottery centre in district Khurja, which led to the shut down of this industry in the year 1992.\\n\\nThe Chinhat pottery cluster was initially started by the Planning Research and Action Institute (PRAI) of the State Planning Department in the year 1957 as a trial project to provide employment, eradicate poverty and to make the villagers self-sufficient in the Chinhat region. PRAI ran the units as Independent, semi-independent and depended on units for about the next 10 years before it got transferred to the U.P Small Industries Corporation (UPSIC) for better organization.\\n\\nThe main speciality of Chinhat pottery is that it is totally handmade with no machinery involved unlike other crafts like making ceramics. Chinhat pottery was refined, well designed and decorated in a colourful form and consisted of Kitchenware, decorative bowls, plates, cup-saucers, containers, flower vases and vessels etc. It is a type of glazed pottery with geometric designs.\\n\\nIn the beginning, women were not allowed to work in the pottery kilns, only the male potters were involved. But with time women also became a part of the pottery making process equally. 11 units of kilns were opened up in Chinhat by the UPSIC, and farmers from the nearby villages as well as potters used to work here together. Around 300- 400 people were involved in the work.\\n\\nPrabhakar Nath, an 80-year-old man has been in the craft of pottery making in Chinhat, ever since 1978. His father too was involved the same craft. His three generations have been a part of this business. He says, “The problem started to arise as UPSIC, stopped providing the basic facilities and amenities to the potters by not providing them credit facilities”.\\n\\nHe adds, “Raw materials and tagnecks which were earlier given free of cost by PRAI were no longer given freely anymore. Earlier PRAI used to assemble all the products made by the 11 kilns and used to help in its marketing, supplying and exporting. But UPSIC did not follow the same trend and they stopped helping in the supply and export of the pottery produced there.”\\n\\nAs a consequence, the entire the burden of marketing and supplying fell on the pottery units themselves. They started selling their products on their own with no help from the UPSIC, mostly in the nearby local markets of cities like Kanpur, Faizabad and Lucknow. The transportation cost of procuring the raw materials also increased.\\n\\nUPSIC had developed one more centre for the pottery making, side by side along with Chinhat, which is called Khurja. Khurja, still is a popular market for pottery and pottery kilns still run there as UPSIC opened new units in the region and better facilities and services were provided to the potters there whereas on the other hand no steps were taken to improve the already dilapidated condition of the Chinhat potters in terms of basic facilities and services. Chinhat pottery was more artistic whereas Khurja pottery was more industrialized.\\n\\nThe UPSIC started its own production unit in Chinhat after sometime called the Mother Factory unit where the same pottery was produced alongside with other independent, semi-dependent pottery kilns around. The production done by the UPSIC factory was quite inferior as compared to the local Chinhat pottery. The pottery produced by them lacked finishing, was uncleaned and lacked the beauty of the original handmade chinhat pottery. The products produced by the UPSIC themselves turned out to be a huge flop in the market and its production was stopped later.\\n\\nUPSIC was under a loss of Rs. 2 crores and the mother unit got shut in the year 1992 by the UPSIC and with that began the doom in the Chinhat Pottery industry when UPSIC stopped providing raw materials to the kilns.\\n\\nThe small pottery units with limited economy could not procure the raw materials on their own from the outside and only 4-5 units among them could work by procuring the materials together in a group from Khurja. The furnaces established in the kilns were all coal-based and with time coal became way too expensive. The cost of production, as a result, started increasing and became more and more with each passing year.\\n\\nWith time the wages of the labourers increased as well along with the increase in the prices of raw materials. The raw materials were procured through Khurja as the small factory owners could not buy it directly from the mines added to the transportation cost. The middlemen in Khurja supplied the raw materials to the Chinhat factories and took a huge amount as their commission.\\n\\nPrabhakar Nath laments, “After a lot of pleading by the potterers and factory owners and writing letters to the government it was decided that Khadi Board Commission might take up the Chinhat cluster in its own hands, but nothing fruitful came out of it. The government left the Chinhat potterers on their own fate”\\n\\nA senior official from State MSME and Export Promotion Ministry says, “Government tried its best to revive the Chinhat pottery in 1992, in order to remove the tag of a sick industry from Chinhat pottery financial aid, special packages and proper assistance was given, a master plan was also chalked out, where subsidies were granted by the government but by that time the demand for the Chinhat pottery had reduced drastically, even after providing them with modern machinery, the units could not gain profit and couldn’t be resurrected. On the other hand, Khurja was nearer to the main market of Delhi-NCR, the transportation was easier and Khurja pottery was much more in demand than of Chinhat’s because of its better finishing and packaging, that is why it is still thriving and we still have its demands from abroad as well.”\\n\\nMore than half of the units in Chinhat district were shut down completely by 1997 whereas some of the units started to manufacture Terracotta disposable items in the remaining ones and these factories till this date carry out terracotta production in Chinhat. The labourers who were involved in the pottery making were mostly farmers from the nearby villages who were hit hard by the shutdown, to escape poverty and unemployment they went back to their original activity of farming and agriculture.\\n\\nThe senior MSME official points out that, “Handmade pottery is not feasible to use in homes on a daily basis because it lacks strength and durability, people buy pottery products nowadays just to keep them as decorative items in their display boxes and do not use it for general household consumption. Chinese products have replaced the traditional Indian pottery now in terms of consumption.”\\n\\nMr Prabhakar Nath wishes that under the new scheme of ODOP - One District One Product launched by the state government if the government could try to bring back to life the traditional Chinhat Pottery industry. He adds,“ It has been more than 22 years since I had to shut down my factory at Chinhat. If new advanced furnaces and machinery are involved along with doorstep availability of raw materials to the factory the pottery can be vivified”.\\n\\nA senior government official from UPSIC says that “Under the One District One Product scheme (ODOP) for Lucknow district, Zardozi and Chikankari work have already been finalized but a ‘Mati Kala’ Board has been set up under the Development Commissioner Of Handicraft (DCF) to promote traditional pottery, for its revival and sustainability in the long run and loan is given to the artisans under the MUDRA scheme. There are promotional events organised by the MSME department, like trade fairs, exhibitions, local expo’s where pottery products are put on display to increase awareness about the handicrafts. If anyone is willing to set up an independent unit by themselves, the government is always ready to help them with the new startup schemes and One Window redressal system.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDASTANGOI:\\n\\n\\nAbdul Halim Sharar in Guzishta Lucknow calls this art as ‘extemporaneous composition’. The development of Urdu language in Lucknow was not only limited to letters and court culture. Contributions were made at all levels of society which caused the language to improve, broaden and assume new aspects which were sources of interest to all classes. One such effort was Dastangoi, the art of story telling. Stories with imaginative instincts were recited by dastangos of Lucknow in 18th & 19th century. Mahmood Farooqui described that in 1881, buoyed by the success of the Amir Hamza story, Munshi Newal Kishore Press, Lucknow embarked on a highly ambitious literary print project. He assembled some of the leading Dastangos of Lucknow and commissioned them to produce the entire Hamza narrative as it existed in oral and written records. The result, by the end of a labour of twenty five years, was a series consisting of 46 huge volumes, each about a thousand pages long. It is the crowning glory of Urdu literary tradition and the summit of a thousand years of the Indo-Islamic composite culture.\\n\\nAbdul Halim Sharar in Guzishta Lucknow calls this art as ‘extemporaneous composition’. The development of Urdu language in Lucknow was not only limited to letters and court culture. Contributions were made at all levels of society which caused the language to improve, broaden and assume new aspects which were sources of interest to all classes. One such effort was Dastangoi, the art of story telling. The Persian word dastangoi is compound to two words dastan and goi which means telling a dastan or story. As we already know India is a land of rich culture and literature, the number of dastans ranges from various fields like: war, pleasure, beauty, love and deception. The art of Dastangoi is like painting pictures by barely using words and expression, and the ability to make a deep rooting connection with the audience which was once lost, is regaining its popularity. It is believed that this art actually originated in Arabia when in pagan times assemblies were held for telling of tales. Even though dastans had many principles and many stories, ‘The tale of Amir Hamza’ composed in Persian by Amir Khusrau was the basis for all other narrations. Amir Hamza, travelled the world in his infancy. His stories are marked by presence of djiins, acts of bravery, prophecies and fairies. Similar sort of stories with imaginative instincts were recited by dastangos of Lucknow in 19th century. It was looked down upon by colonialists and was considered as immoral and obscene. Women were also restricted from participation. It was 1928, when Mir Babar Ali a famous dastango passed away that the art saw its end.\\n\\nThe first modern Dastangoi performance took place on 4th May 2005 at the India International Auditorium after the recent revival of the art by Mahmood Farooqui and his dedicated team which includes Darain Shahidi, Ankit Chadha, Danish Hussain, Fouzia, etc. They wish to spread the lost art of dastangoi from Delhi to Lucknow to Lahore to New York and across Globe. They have added innovations to the art of dastangoi like participation of women which was earlier restricted only to men, Fouzia being one of the main woman propagator of the art. They have also added many new themes to the art of dastangoi like cult personalities, fictional stories, on cities, writers and even on current issues like sedition! Some of their popular pieces are Dastsan Azar Jadu Ki, Dastan-e Lahore, Dastan Akhtari, Dastan-e Partition, Dastan-e Chouboli, Tilism-e Hoshruba, etc. Mahmood Farooqui described that “In 1881, buoyed by the success of the Hamza story, Nawal Kishore Press, Lucknow embarked on a highly ambitious literary print project. He assembled some of the leading Dastangos of Lucknow and commissioned them to produce the entire Hamza narrative as it existed in oral and written records. The team of three writers Mohammed Husain Jah, Ahmed Husain Qamar and Sheikh Tasadduq Husain, joined later by others, started work on reproducing in print the virtual entirety of the Hamza tradition. The result, by the end of a labour of twenty five years, was a series consisting of 46 huge volumes, each about a thousand pages long. Each of the volumes could be read as an independent entity, or one could read it as part of the whole. The 46 volume Hamza cycle is the crowning glory of Urdu literary tradition and the summit of a thousand years of the Indo-Islamic story telling tradition”.

Moreover, hockey and Lucknow have a special relationship as the city has produced legends like him, Jaman Lal Sharma, Sayyed Ali, Sujeet Kumar. This special relationship has found a place in my Dastangoi scheduled on November 21 at Jaipuria Institute of Management as a tribute to the legend.\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know whether the people will like this experiment of creating a Dastan on the life of a sports legend as I have no one sponsoring this event.

Besides, I have met his son, VV Singh, to get minor details about his life. I have tried to portray each and every aspect of his life starting from childhood to old age. To get an insight of his life, I met a number of hockey players who learnt the tricks of trade from him.

He was the one who established the Sports College, Sports Hostel in Lucknow for sportspersons. He never got his due in his life in his own state despite being considered the best in hockey during his time in the world. He actually deserved Bharat Ratna.”\\n\\nDastangoi (Urdu: داستان گوئی) is a 13th century Urdu oral storytelling art form. The Persian style of dastan evolved in 16th century. One of the earliest references in print to dastangoi is a 19th-century text containing 46 volumes of the adventures of Amir Hamza titled Dastan e Amir Hamza.\\n\\nThe art form reached its zenith in the Indian sub-continent in the 19th century and is said to have died with the demise of Mir Baqar Ali in 1928. Dastangoi was revived by historian, author and director Mahmood Farooqui in 2005.Syed Sahil Agha has amalgamated Dastangoi with music & singing in 2010.\\n\\nAt the centre of dastangoi is the dastango, or storyteller, whose voice is his main artistic tool in orally recreating the dastan or the story. Notable 19th-century dastangos included Amba Prasad Rasa, Mir Ahmad Ali Rampuri, Muhammad Amir Khan, Syed Husain Jah, and Ghulam Raza.\\n\\nDastangoi has its origin in the Persian language. Dastan means a tale; the suffix -goi makes the word mean \"to tell a tale\"\\n\\nIndian urban anthropologist Ghaus Ansari ascribed the origin of dastangoi to Pre-Islamic Arabia, and detailed how the eastward spread of Islam carried dastangoi to Iran and then to Delhi in India. From Delhi, dastangoi made its way to Lucknow in the 18th century, aided by the Indian Rebellion of 1857, during which several artists, writers and dastangos moved from Delhi to Lucknow.\\n\\nIn Lucknow, dastangoi was popular across all classes, and was regularly performed at diverse locations including chowks (city squares), private households, and afeem khana (public opium houses). \"It became so popular among opium addicts that they made listening to stories an important element of their gatherings,\" wrote Ansari. \"The prolonged intoxication and prolonged stories narrated by professional story-tellers was mostly combined. Each afeem khana had its own story-teller to entertain the clients; whereas, among the rich, every household used to appoint a dastango as a member of its staff.\" According to Abdul Halim Sharar, the noted author and historian of nineteenth century Lucknow, the Art of dastangoi, was divided under the following headings:\"War\", \"Pleasure, \"Beauty\", \"Love\" and \"Deception\".\\n\\n\\nDastangoi was revived by Mahmood Farooqui in 2005. Since then, he has performed thousands of shows across the world.\\nThe early dastango\\'s told tales of magic, war and adventure, and borrowed freely from other stories such as the Arabian Nights, storytellers such as Rumi, and storytelling traditions such as the Panchatantra. From the 14th century, Persian dastangois started focusing on the life and adventures of Amir Hamza, the paternal uncle of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Indian stream of dastangoi added storytelling elements such as aiyyari (trickery) to these tales.\\n\\nList of early Urdu Dastans\\nSab Ras - Mulla Wajhi\\nNau tarz-i murassa‘ - Husain ‘Atā Khān Tahsīn\\nNau ā\\'īn-i hindī (Qissa-i Malik Mahmūd Gīti-Afroz) - Mihr Chand Khatrī\\nJazb-i ‘ishq - Shāh Husain Haqīqat\\nNau tarz-i murassa‘ - Muhammad Hādī a.k.a.

The Lucknow court emerged as the centre of Urdu poetry as it received poets from Delhi with much enthusiasm.[17] Chief among these poets were Khaliq, Zamir, Aatish, and Nasikh.[18] Other poets included Anis and Dabir.\\n\\nThe troubles at Delhi towards the end of eighteenth century and beginning of nineteenth century proved to be a blessing for the people of literary taste at Lucknow, as the ongoing issues on a day-to-day basis and the environment there was not conducive for the men of thoughts and those having seas of expressions thriving in their hearts and minds. The situation developed into a scenario where intellectual migration started to happen and choices were very limited where courts were willing to welcome the poets. Out of possible centres, the main were Hyderabad, Patna and Lucknow. With these choices, Lucknow was not only the nearest in terms of distance but also comparatively secured as both, the court and the people of Lucknow were enthusiastic to embrace the poetic genre looking for solace and the surroundings were fertile. Though, it was realised very early that there was a gulf of differences in the ideology of the poetry of two cities.\\n\\nJourney of Urdu Poetry\\n\\nThe poetry of Lucknow was very particular about the words as compared to Delhi, it gave itself up to external things, such as outward ornament, rather than beauty of thought, whereas Delhi school was very focussed on the subject and thought. Delhi had vigour for style and depth of thought against the verbal accuracy and idiomatic usage prevalent at Lucknow. This alliance resulted in a new blend of rules, language and idioms, restricted poetic license and laid down laws for prosody and figures of speech, specially similes and metaphors. In the desire for power in the use of words, Lucknow increased the length of the lyric and the number of rhymes.\\n\\nThe court of Lucknow being run by the Nawab having Shia faith laid a strong base for those poets who mastered in the art of narration took up the penning of elegies or Marsiya, the poetic description of the tragic events at Karbala. This art was primarily evolved in Persia and was brought to Lucknow purely on religious grounds. In the beginning, these elegies were short devotional poems and little attention was paid to their literary quality. With the passage of time, this form of poetry occupied the vacuum of epic that was not present in the Muslim society.\\n\\nThe epics of Karbala include historic narrative, moral and didactic teaching, description of natural scenery and delineation of human emotion. Lucknow gradually turned out to be a nursery that was to boast of nurturing the raw talent and bring out the best from the future generations who gave Urdu some new dimensions and unparalleled place in the history of literature. Practically it would not be possible to talk about all the poets in one article, however the best of attempt is to highlight the era that gave Lucknow a place and significance in literature.\\n\\nHere we go through some great names who laid the foundation of poetic mastery at Lucknow during 18th and 19th centuries:\\n\\nMeer Taqi Meer :\\n\\nFaqeeraana Aaye Sadaa Kar Chalay\\nMiyaan Khush Raho Hum Dua Kar Chalay\\n\\nBorn in 1723 at Agra, his first visit to Lucknow in 1748 opened the gates of literary fancies for the place and the court of Asaf-ud-Daula extended an invite for him to stay there permanently. However, Meer migrated to Lucknow much later in 1782 to live here until his death in 1810. His Kulliyaat-e-Meer consists of six Deewan and his Masnavi Muamalaat-e-Ishq is one of the greatest known poems in Urdu literature. Basing his language on his native Hindustani, he leavened it with a sprinkling of Persian diction and phraseology, and created a poetic language at once simple, natural and elegant, which was to guide generations of future poets.\\n\\nMir Mustahsan Khaliq : The son of Mir Hasan and more famously the father of Mir Anis was one of the earliest elegiac writers in North India. Born in 1774, Khaliq lived until 1804 and during his relatively small life, he took his ability to the heights where on one occasion at his native place, Faizabad, he recited his work with such an effect that Aatish, the legendary of his times, gave up to recite his own lyrics saying that it was not needed when Khaliq was there.\\n\\nMuzaffar Husain Zamir : A contemporary of Khaliq, Zamir was known better as a pair to former and was a learned man. He is credited to have taken elegies to an advanced level, both in terms of the length as well as the narration. He took into account the battles, the horses, accoutrements and the natural scenery. His works described historical events with a view to increasing religious fervour. He is known for his tough language and fancied style of writings.\\n\\nShah Tura’ab Ali Qalandar : The second head of the Sufi Khankhaah (monastery) at Kakori, Shah Tura’ab Ali Qalandar composed marvels in poetry in praise of Lord Krishna. His composition ‘Saant Ras’ is by far considered to be a masterpiece depicting Awadhi language. Falling in line with the philosophy of mysticism, his poetry captured the hearts of those who searched to find the consummation of self. He was one of the first Sufi poets of his times to lay the foundation of communal harmony through the powerful cord of literature.\\n\\nKaramat Ali Shahidi : He was a native of Bareilly but brought up in Lucknow, he lived a careless life initially but became very religious person during the later course of life. He was known for writing poems in difficult meters. His recorded teachers were Mushafi and Shah Nasir. In one of his odes, Shahidi had expressed his desire to die in Madina and as the destiny had in store, he passed away at Madina during his pilgrimage in the year 1840.\\n\\nDaya Shankar Kaul Nasim : A native Kashmiri Pandit, Nasim won accolades primarily on his one poem Gulzar-e-Nasim which he wrote at the age of 22. He was a student of Aatish and he is also credited to have presented the earliest Urdu translation of The Arabian Nights. Nasim passed away in the year 1843 at the age of 32.\\n\\nHaider Ali Aatish : One of the key figures that earned Lucknow a name in Urdu literature that it is today, always remembered for his association with Nasikh, so much so that Aatish gave up writing after the death of Nasikh and he himself passed away in the year 1846. Aatish was a natural poet and used simple, colloquial language, the language of everyday speech. He had a powerful physique and was a swordsman himself. Aatish is considered to be one of the finest Urdu poets had compiled two collections of his poems.\\n\\nImam Baksh Nasikh : A contemporary of Aatish, they jointly correspond to the style of Mir and Sauda of earlier generation. Nasikh is regarded as the master of words, he was very fond of using Arabic and Persian words and made minimal use of the local dialects. Nasikh may be credited for making a more common use of the word ‘ghazal’ that was earlier largely practiced as ‘Rekhta’. On the other hand, Nasikh’s poetry is also labelled as bombastic and obscure, that his poetry which was largely influenced by Persian was full of sound and fury but was devoid of poetry.\\n\\nAgha Hajju Sharf : A pupil of Aatish, Hajju is considered to be one of the torch-bearers of the movement that was against the usage of Persian in Urdu poetry. Abdus Salam and Safir Bilgrami have pointed out that Hajju rejected the whole vocabulary of the wine shop that was prevalent in Urdu Poetry.\\n\\nVazir Ali Saba : Another pupil of Aatish, born in 1795 and is credited with his collection of lyrics by the name of ‘Ghuncha-e-Aarzoo’ or a bunch of desires. This collection is known for its idiomatic usage of Urdu.\\n\\nMuhammad Vazir Vazir : He was a pupil of Nasikh and was regarded as the greatest of the minor poets of his times. He was a very religious man. A contemporary of Saba, his work titled Daftar-i-Fasahat is known for its imagination and subject matter.\\n\\nMuhammad Khan Rind : Born in 1797 at Faizabad, he lived initial years at his native place before he reached Lucknow. He had so much of influence of Aatish that he destroyed all his works that he compiled during his early years and started from scratch to compile Guldasta-i-Ishq. He took up the religious life during the middle age and passed away in 1857 on the way to Makkah where he was to perform his pilgrimage.\\n\\nAli Ausat Rashk : Born in 1799, a pupil of Nasikh, Rashk gave himself up almost entirely to improve the language and laying down rules for it. He was very fond of the colloquial, which he employed freely in his poems. He became a great authority on all points connected with idioms and use of words. He had two collections of poems, namely Nazm-i-Mubarak and Nazm-i- Giraami, the third collection that was said to be the best, was lost. He also compiled Urdu dictionary called Nafs-ul-Lughaat. He passed away in 1867.\\n\\nMuhammad Riza Barq : A pupil of Nasikh, Barq was fond of far-fetched metaphors and similes, he wrote voluminously as he was attached to the Royal court under Wajid Ali Shah. Barq followed his Royal master into exile and wrote a rather uninspired account of his own loneliness before he died towards the end of 1857.\\n\\nHatim Ali Beg Mihr : Born in 1814, Mihr is better known as a correspondent to Ghalib, than for his poetic prowess. Mihr’s biggest achievement refers to Ghalib’s admiration of his work Shuaa-i-Mihr. He is also credited with his collection of poems by the name of Almas-i-Darakhshaan.\\n\\nImdaad Ali Bahr : Born in 1810, Bahr was one of the chief disciples of Nasikh, along with Vazir and Rashk. Bahr was a poor man who used to sit on a mat everyday and likeminded people used to visit him and discuss poetry. He was sponsored by the Nawab of Rampur, Kalb Ali Khan who paid him the salary and attached him to the court but Bahr returned to Lucknow out of his own choice.\\n\\nIsmail Husain Munir : Born in 1819, Munir was a wanderer poet and most famous of his work is Ma’arij-ul- Mazameen, he was a typical poet of his time. The collections of Munir’s poem are titled as Muntakhibat-uI-Aalam, Tanvir-ul-Ash’aar and Nazm-i-Munir. He passed away in the year 1881.\\n\\nMahdi Hasan Khan Aabaad : His compiled anthology is known as Baharistan-i-Sukhan and he wrote a great deal of verses. The best known lyrics penned by Aabaad are Nigaristan-i-Ishq.\\n\\nWajid Ali Shah Akhtar : All the Nawabs of Lucknow demonstrated their writing abilities but the most prolific among all has been the name of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah during his reign from 1846 to 1856. The poetic description of his exile Huzn-i-Akhtar is a wonderful piece of writing. Some of the unpublished manuscripts of Wajid Ali Shah are still preserved with the British Museum. His last sh’er, penned reportedly upon his departure from Lucknow is often proclaimed as his masterpiece:\\n\\nDar-o-Deewar Pe Hasrat Se Nazar Karte Hain\\nKhush Raho Ahl-e-Watan, Hum Tu Safar Karte Hain\\n\\n(At some places, the second misra’a (line) of the couplet is reported as: Rukhsat ! Ahl-e-Watan, Hum Tu Safar Karte Hain)\\n\\nMuzaffar Ali Khan Aseer : Born in the year 1800, Aseer was one of the courtiers of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah who is known for his articles on grammar and prosody. Aseer also became more famous because of his pupils, namely Ameer Ahmad Minai and Ahmad Ali Shauq. He died in the year 1881.\\n\\nArshad Ali Khan Qalaq : He is regarded by some as one of the greatest writers of Masnavi (poetry of romances), he is also credited with his work on Qaiserbagh and some other eulogiums of his master Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. Qalaq’s work Tilism-i-Ulfat became very popular at its time and had a high regard in the works of romanticism.\\n\\nMahdi Ali Khan Zaki : He is known for his book on rhyme and prosody titled Yaad Gir, published in 1848. He also authored the short story of Punjab in the year 1850. Zaki is reported to have spent most of his life wandering from one court to another.\\n\\nAli Khan Darakhshan : He is known for his moral and didactic poems in a good colloquial style with rather fanciful conceits. Along with Barq, Darakhshan accompanied Nawab Wajid Ali Shah into exile.\\n\\nAgha Hasan Amaanat : Born in 1815, Amaanat is credited with writing the first Urdu drama Indar Sabha along with number of elegies in honour of Imam Hasan and Imam Husain. He passed away in the year 1858.\\n\\nBabar Ali Anis : Born in 1802, Anis is regarded as the one who took the art of Urdu elegiac poetry to the highest point in terms of literary artwork. Remembered as a pair to Dabir, jointly they surfaced as a combination as that of Mir and Sauda of the previous century. Anis boasts to have a bloodline filled with poetic abilities, his great-grandfather was Zaahik, grandfather was Mir Hasan and father was Khaliq. The trend continued even down the line and his son Nafees earned a name for himself, his grandson was Jalees and even his great-grandson Aarif held on to the poetic baton for seventh consecutive generation. One of the most renowned names of Urdu poetry, Munis was the brother of Anis. He and his family are famous for the usage of pure and idiomatic Urdu that makes the works very simple, easy and flowing. Anis’ works are published in over four volumes and most famous among all remains Waaqia-i-Karbala, a volume of selections so connected as to make a single story. Anis passed away in 1874 at Lucknow.\\n\\nSalamat Ali Dabir : Born in 1803, Dabir completes the duo with Anis, his poetry demonstrated of more scholarship and bears a strong power of imagination. The ideas of Dabir were sometimes fanciful and clever rather than impressive, and his pathos was much true to life than the real sorrow depicted in the verses of Anis. He wrote about half the works of Anis and primarily confined himself towards penning elegies. In 1858, Dabeer went to Murshidabad and in 1859 to Patna. Dabeer left a worthy son in Mirza Muhammad Ja’afar poetically surnamed Auj who followed in the footsteps of his father. He was a great scholar and was regarded as an authority on prosody on which he had published a treatise. Dabeer died in year 1875 at Lucknow.\\n\\nIt is imperative here to mention the greatness of poetic and intellectual level of Anis and Dabir with this reported incident, when Anis was critically ill, Dabir visited him and casually asked “Kahiye Anis, Tabiyat Bakhair Hai”, without wasting any time but with great difficulty, Anis responded “Jaam Bhar Chuka, Chhalakne Ki Der Hai”. This signifies the relations between the two masters and their poetic abilities.\\n\\nMir Muhammad Nawab Munis : The lineage and family of Munis was itself enough to launch him as a poet but despite being son of Khaliq and brother of Anis, his works left a place for himself and signify his own identity. He had a great command over the language which he showed in his elegies. His power of recitation was far-famed but by and large he remained to be a very religious man and was hardly seen unless he was reciting his elegies at religious gatherings. His works were published in two volumes. Munis passed away in the year 1875.\\n\\nNawab Mirza Shauq : A pupil of Aatish, Shauq is mainly known for his four Masnavi, namely Bahar-i-Ishq, Zahr-i- Ishq, Lazzat-i-Ishq and Fareb-i-Ishq. His works possess an excellent choice of rhymes and enjoyed considerable amount of popularity. Shauq passed away in the year 1871.\\n\\nSayyid Mirza Ta’ashshuq : He was the son of Mirza Mir Uns and brother of Husain Mirza Ishq, hailing from the literary background his elegies surpassed all others of his time in the pathos which Ta’ashshuq infused. His words well chosen and his ideas were striking despite very ordinary quality of lyrics at times. He passed away in the year 1891.\\n\\nHusain Mirza Ishq : He was the elder brother of Sayyid Mirza Ta’ashshuq and penned elegies that were published in two volumes. His popularity was con␣ned as he usually did not participate in the public functions and was very much confined to solace. He passed away in the year 1890.\\n\\nKhursheed Ali Nafis : Descendant of a great lineage, Nafis was the son of great Mir Anis and nephew of Munis. Born in 1819, Nafis had the quality to hold enthralled the audiences which went to hear him recite. He wrote a great deal, but only one small volume has been published. He strongly followed the traditions of the family and passed away at the dawn of twentieth century in 1901.\\n\\nMustafa Mirza Rashid : Born in 1845, the son-in-law of the great Mir Anis and nephew of Ishq and Ta’ashshuq, Rashid ventured with writing many love lyrics. He is said to have evolved the style of penning elegies with the description of spring. Rashid chose to adopt the styles of his uncles and managed a reasonable space for him in the literary circuit. He passed away in the year 1917.\\n\\nAli Muhammad Aarif : Born in 1861, the grandson of Nafis and great-grandson of Mir Anis, Aarif primarily resembled Nafis in his works, poetic style and character. Having started with love poems, he later on confined to elegies and earned a name for himself. He passed away in the year 1916.\\n\\nAmeer Minai : Born in 1828 to the family of Maulvi Karam Mohammad Minai, he was a descendant of Sufi Saint Makhdoom Shah Mina of Lucknow. It was not easy for a poet to establish himself in the era of Ghalib and Daagh but Ameer Minai mastered that and not only this but also he was one privileged poet to have witness the times of both Ghalib and Iqbal. He is widely known not only for his poetic prowess but also as a scholar, writer, translator and connoisseur of the Urdu language. His range of study stretched from law to logic and from mathematics to history. He not only penned Ghazal but also Naat, poetic praise of the Prophet Mohammad PBUH. His collections of Ghazal are Meerat-ul- Ghaib and Sanamkhane-e-Ishq, whereas his collections of devotional prose are Khayaabaan-e-Aafreenish and Mahaamid-e-Khatam-un-Nabiyyeen.\\n\\nThe above reference cannot claim to have covered the entire list that contains the men of poetic legacy but it is a nutshell attempt to remember most of them.\\n\\nAt the onset of Twentieth Century\\n\\nThis was the time when Lucknow was at the forefront of the political developments happening all across the country and its impact was all but visible in the literary works of the then poets, writers and authors. Lyrics of love were overshadowed by thoughts of revolution and the sorrows of elegies were crying further with the canvas of religious ideological differences.\\n\\nThe flavour and colours of the poetry that were emerging during the beginning of twentieth century were very different from the previous generation.\\n\\nThe people of Lucknow and surroundings woke up to the new century with very different poetic voices, a great name of Ameer Minai had just passed away at far-off Hyderabad but the later years blessed the city with some of yet another greats like Maulana Syed Fazl-ul-Hasan Hasrat Mohani, Choudhary Jagat Mohan Lal Rawaan, Shabbir Hasan Khan Josh Malihabadi, Brij Narain Chakbast, Asrarul Haq Majaaz, Anand Narain Mulla, Aal-e- Ahmad Suroor, Mohammad Shafi Khan Bekal Utsahi, Ali Sardar Jafri, Waali Aasi, Khumaar Barabankvi, Saghar Khayyami and many more.\\n\\nThe all new breed of poets continued the legacy and despite all the turmoil that was happening during the first half of the century, Urdu poetry continued to flourish with some of the great names and some that could not achieve the much deserved recognition based on their literary acumen.\\n\\nAabaad Lucknowi\\nAal-e-Raza Lucknowi\\nAarzoo Lucknowi\\nAbr, Bishan Narain Dar\\nAftaab Lucknowi\\nAhsan Lucknowi\\nAish, Fida Ali\\nAsr, Ja’afar Ali Khan\\nAsr, Jai Narayan Verma\\nAziz Lucknowi\\nBambuq, Vilayat Ali\\nBarq, Jwala Prasad\\nBehzad Lucknowi\\nChakbast, Brij Narayan\\nChirkeen, Baaqar Ali\\nDilgeer, Chhannu Lal\\nFarhat, Shankar Dayal\\nFasaahat Lucknowi\\nGoya, Faqeer Mohammad Khan\\nGulshan, Raja Jiya Lal\\nHairat, Mirza\\nHamid Siddiqui Lucknowi\\nHijr, Bishambhar Nath\\nHimmat, Bansi Dhar\\nJadeed Lucknowi\\nJauhar, Munshi Javahir Singh\\nJurrat, Shaikh Qalandar Baksh\\nKamaal, Hakeem Mahdi\\nKashif Lucknowi\\nKhanjar Lucknowi\\nKhushtar, Jagannath Sahai\\nLataafat Lucknowi\\nMaroof, Ilaahi Baksh\\nMachis Lucknowi\\nMahshar, Kazim Husain\\nMahvi, Siddiqui Lucknowi\\nMohsin Kakorvi\\nMuhazzab Lucknowi\\nMunawwar, Bisheshwar Prasad\\nMunshi Nawal Kishor\\nMunshi Sajjad Husain\\nNawazish Lucknowi\\nNihaal, Chandi Sahai\\nNoor, Krishna Bihari\\nQadr, Mirza Sikandar Beg\\nRangeen, Saadat Yaar Khan\\nRaunaq, Ram Sahai\\nResh, Sukh Dayal Saxena\\nRuswa, Mirza Muhammad Hadi\\nSaabit Lucknowi\\nSaahir Lucknowi\\nSaaqib Lucknowi\\nSaboor, Gopal Sahai\\nSajni, Syed Sajid Ali\\nSarshaar, Ratan Nath\\nShaad, Muhammad Jaan\\nShafaq, Lalta Prasad\\nSharar, Abdul Haleem\\nSitamzareef, Machchhu Beg\\nUfaq, Dwarka Prasad\\nYaas, Zakir Husain\\nZareef Lucknowi\\n\\nBorn in 1723, Meer was orphaned and left to subsist and survive on his own at the age of 11. After living in Delhi for a while, he moved to Lucknow on the invitation of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, where he lived till his demise in the year 1810. One of the pioneers of Urdu literature, Meer Taqi Meer (also spelled as Mir Taqi Mir) was a man without an address in life and death (his place of burial is untraceable now).\\n\\nReminisced for his poetic pathos and melancholy, Meer is revered as the \\'Khuda-e-Sukhan\\' (God of poetry) in the world of Urdu literature. It is said that it was Meer who constituted a new elite language in Lucknow called \\'Rekhta\\' or \\'Hindui\\' which is an amalgamation of Urdu and Persian. Here is a heart-rendering verse from the legend that has been used multiple times by various lyricists and writers.\\n\\n\"Patta patta boota boota haal hamara jaane hai\\n\\nJaane na jaane gul hi na jaane baagh to saara jaane hai\"\\n\\nFamous works: Zikr-e Meer, Faiz-e Meer, Mu\\'amlat-e-Ishq, Kulliyat-e-Mir\\n\\nMirza Hadi Ruswa\\n\\nBorn in Lucknow as Mirza Muhammad Hadi in 1858, this legend from the City of Nawabs wrote under the pseudonym \\'Ruswa\\' in poetry and \\'Mirza Ruswa\\' in novel writing. Ruswa sharpened his writing skills under the tutelage of Mirza Dabir and after his death, Ruswa sought help from his son Mirza Jafar Auj.\\n\\nAll of Mirza\\'s literary writings, poetry, and other compositions were created in Lucknow before he moved to Hyderabad in 1920. Some of the writings that he is renowned for are based in Lucknow, for instance the novel based on Umrao Jan — the renowned courtesan of the city. Here\\'s a couplet by the poet, who breathed his last on October 21, 1931,\\n\\n\"Dil lagane ko na samjho dil-lagi\\n\\nDushmanon ki jaan par ban jaegi\"\\n\\nFamous work: Umrao Jan Ada\\n\\nSafi Lakhnawi\\n\\nBorn as Syed Ali Naqi Zaidi in 1862, in a Zaidi Syed family of Awadh, Safi Lakhnavi started writing at the tender age of 13 under the pen name of \\'Safi\\'. Back when having an Ustad was the norm for every writer, this literary legend used to write on his own without the help of a guide. Safi\\'s poetry is known for its simplicity and sweetness. It reflects the prevalent socio-political and cultural state of Lucknow of his time.\\n\\nHis words, being reformist and innovative in their tonality, made him popular among the common folks as a people\\'s poet. Safi, who breathed his last in 1950, gained his own distinctive identity by his unusual way of writing, unlike the traditional Urdu poetry. Here\\'s a couplet by the poet that highlights his unique style of poetry,\\n\\n\"Dekhe baghair haal ye hai iztirab ka\\n\\nKya jaane kya ho parda jo uthe naqab ka\"\\n\\nFamous works: Aagosh-e-Maadar, Tanzeem-ul-Hayaat, and Deewan-i-Safi.\\n\\nHasrat Mohani\\n\\nAn eminent poet, an activist and a freedom fighter of the Indian independence movement, Syed Fazl-ul-Hasan was born in 1875. Famous as \\'Hasrat Mohani\\', his allonym, this legendary poet played an important role in keeping the original form of ghazal alive at a time when it was being neglected. One of the first people to call for \\'Azaadi-e-Kaamil\\' (complete independence) from the British rule in 1921, Hasrat coined the famous clarion call of Independence movement, \\'Inquilab Zindabad\\'.\\n\\nA staunch opposer of the partition, Mohani was a member of the Constituent Assembly that drafted the Indian Constitution as well. Even after his demise on May 13, 1951 in Lucknow, his legacy lives on through his ghazals which have a classical yet modern appeal to it. Here is a couplet from his famous ghazal that featured in the movie Nikaah in 1970,\\n\\n\"Chupke chupke raat din aansu bahana yaad hai\\n\\nHam ko ab tak aashiqui ka vo zamana yaad hai\"\\n\\nFamous work: Mushahidat-e-Zindaan\\n\\nMajaz\\n\\nBorn in 1911, in a town of Lucknow (formerly called Awadh), Asrarul Haq was as a contemporary of some renowned names in Urdu literature like Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Sardar Jafari and Sahir Ludhianvi, among others. The poet wrote under the nom de plume \\'Majaz\\'. His words, unlike others, were famed for being a slightly musical.\\n\\nMajaz garnered fame for his lyrical poetry which was more adored at the time than Faiz\\'s \\'Mujhse Pehli Is Muhabbat\\' and Sahir Ludhianvi\\'s \\'Taj Mahal\\'. With his demise in 1955 in Lucknow, Majaz left a void in the world of poetry that couldn\\'t be filled by anyone else. Here is a famous Sher by the poet known for his revolutionary and romantic poetry,\\n\\n\"Kya kya hua hai hum se junoon mein na puchhiye,\\n\\nUljhe kabhi zameen se kabhi asmaan se hum\"\\n\\nFamous works: Shab-e-taab, Aahang, Saaz-e-Nau, Aligarh Muslim University Tarana (Anthem)\\n\\nAnwar Nadeem\\n\\nAnwar Kamal Khan, born in Malihabad on 22 October, 1937, carried forward the legacy of his ancestors like Josh Malihabadi by committing himself to Urdu literature under the pseudonym \\'Anwar Nadeem\\'. Anwar was not just an acclaimed Urdu writer and poet but also a satirist, humourist, critic, dramatist, journalist, theatre and film actor, short-story writer, screenplay writer and an actor.\\n\\nFamous for his impeccable Lakhnavi accent, Anwar gave a power-packed performance in J P Dutta\\'s film Umrao Jaan. Selected to play the role of Mir Hadi \\'Ruswa\\', the author, he ended up doing the narration of the 2006 movie as well. Born and lived in Lucknow all his life, Anwar breathed his last on 9 August, 2017.\\n\\nWith more than 13 books to his credit, his work relishes the true essence of Lucknow which is loved and appreciated by the readers. Here is a timeless couplet by this multi-talented legend of Lucknow,\\n\\n\"Ho sakta hai koi humein bhi dhunde in banjaron mein,\\n\\nJaane kis ki khoj mein kab se phirte hain bazaron men\"\\n\\nFamous works: Safarnama, Maidan, Jai Shri Ram, Kirchein.\\n\\nThe vast and rich history in Urdu poetry stands for the valuable poetic vibe of Lucknow and remains as one of the things that makes you proud of the city.

The artisans, who, through their intelligent application of metallurgy, make copper and brass[3] vessels safe for culinary use. The art of ‘kalai’ is essentially a process involving deposition of tin on the surface of copper and brass vessels, and is alternatively called – ‘tinning’. This is done to ensure that a uniform tin coating obstructs any possible reaction between the vessel and the organic acids present in the food or the environment.[2] The people practicing the art of kalai as their profession are popularly called kalai-walas. Surprisingly, other than tin, they only require heat, nausadar (local name for ammonium nitrate) and caustic soda to make these vessels medicinal, harmless and enduring in nature.\\n\\nGiven the concision involved in both method and material, it seems strange that this pragmatic technique isn’t widely known. In contrast, one might find that even after being pushed to oblivion by society, personal blogs and YouTube [5] channels run by art and cuisine enthusiasts can’t seem to stop espousing the beauty and benefits of kalai. This makes it imperative to investigate – why?\\n\\n‘In Lucknow, the kalai work is divided between 5-6 shops scattered about the main Yahiyaganj market and some in Chowk. In dark, dingy, old edifices that could comfortably belong to the last century, as in fact they do, artisans perform the interesting task of donning a utensil fit with kalai.’[6] While a few artisians have certainly managed to hold on to the practice and sustain themselves, this piece of writing relies only on online sources of information. The data has been extracted from various personal blogs, newspaper clippings and Youtube videos available on the internet, which have then been categorized and analysed under three themes – science, society and sustenance. The delicate balance of these three traits may as well be the perfect brewing point for an intervention that is truly exemplary in nature. The insights from the analysis could lead us to better understand what constitutes a ‘good design’ and how we – as designer – can make a design ‘good’.\\n\\nTo fully understand and imagine the art of kalai, it is necessary to set our premise in the time when copper and brass utensils were the mainstay of the kitchens. ‘This was the time when the reverberating call, “Bhande kalai kara lo” (get your vessels re-tinned) was the most banal and everyday sound of the city.’[7] The practice would unfold a series of events that would almost appear like magic show to first-time spectators. The soiled and tarnished brass and copper kitchenware would play the protagonist in an hour-long show and emerge gleaming and sparkling like new. However, it must be noted, there is practical scientific wisdom to this ‘art’.\\n\\nCopper and brass have time and again been applauded for being the best metals to cook food in. Their high conductivity spreads the heat evenly across the surface of the utensil, cooking the food thoroughly and evenly. This imparts a unique lingering flavour that makes the food taste better and also by some means ensures the nourishment of the digestive system. [7] On the flip side, these metals are prone to reacting with the organic acids present in the food, leading to discolouration, bitterness and even production of toxins. The kalai-wala circumvented these ills through kalai and made the vessels safe for use. This made him an invaluable addition to ‘the whole social spectrum ranging from royal bawarchiwalas (chefs) to regular households.’\\n\\nThe fascinating show of kalai-wala wouldrequire only a few ingredients but a lot of practice. Mr. Nausad in his interview by Chef Harish Tiwari explains that when work was abundant, artisans used to move around on their bicycle carrying a blower, charcoal, tin metal strips and other necessary tools and chemicals. The process would start with a thorough cleansing of the utensil with caustic soda to remove any foreign impurities. In the next step, it would be washed with an acid that contains a gold purifying compound ‘Sufa’, a salt and another element. It would then be immediately wiped clean to avoid leaving a mark. Simultaneously, a temporary blast furnace was prepared by digging a pit in the ground and airing the charcoal ember with bellows. As the utensils heated up, a tiny piece of tin was placed on its blasting hot surface. It would melt instantly and then be rubbed on the utensil using a cotton pad dipped in nausadar (ammonium chloride) powder. The process would culminate in a hissing sound from the newly tinned scalding hot vessel being dipped in water to cool it down. [4] It is to be noted that there is astounding finesse in being able to curl this molten tin to form a perfectly uniform layer inside a 600o C hot vessel while an opaque white-grey smoke billows off and engulfs the eyes. This is an art, perfected over decades to achieve a flawless, glossy and smooth surface every single time.\\n\\nTo draw better insights about design thinking and design approach, the question that must be posed is:\\n\\nWhat are the qualities embodied by kalai that we could learn from?\\n\\nEvery exemplary practice appears to be an ideal entwinement of science, society and sustenance. In isolation, these might seem like easy targets, but to establish an equilibrium that benefits all and harms none is an art that indigenous practices have mastered to a great degree, making them the recipient of everyone’s awe and appreciation.\\n\\nTo understand the science behind kalai, it is essential to first understand the science of using copper and brass kitchenware. These metals due to their high-conductivity allow for even cooking and efficient use of fuel (firewood), procuring which used to be a physically intensive task. It’s also said that when water is stored in copper vessels for a significant amount of time, traces of it get dissolved in water. In scientific parlance, this effect is called ‘Oligodynamic effect’. Due to copper’s toxic effect on living cells, a wide range of moulds, fungi, algae and other harmful microbes present in the water get easily destroyed. Simply put, it’s nature’s aqua-guard. [10]\\n\\nUsing copper vessels not only helps in water filtration but also provides the required daily dose of the essential micronutrient. This ‘stimulates the brain, promotes bone strength, aids in digestion, regulates body fat, is anti-carcinogenic, regulates the functioning of thyroid glands, prevents joint pains, aids in haemoglobin synthesis, maintains acid-alkaline balance in the body, helps in healing of internal wounds and slows down ageing due to its antioxidant property.’ [10] These assorted benefits further endorse the practice of kalai which forms an inert barrier that preserves the positive aspects of copper and brass while keeping their adverse effects (that arise due to their high reactivity) at bay.\\n\\nBefore the invention of stainless steel, copper and brass were widely used for a variety of purposes. The practice of kalai, by tackling the issue of corrosion in these metals benefitted the entire spectrum of the society. The only question it asked is, is the material copper or brass?\\n\\nAn appropriate analogy to illustrate the communal contributions of this practice would be that of an alarm clock.\\n\\nJust as an alarm clocks alerts us about the time, the kalaiwalas’ call served a similar role but on a regional scale. His call was a periodic reminder for people to inspect their utensils and ensure that their health was not at risk. This brought about a sense of interdependence between the community and the artisan, each looking out for themselves by looking out for each other. Also, kalai, being a physically intense and time-consuming yet extremely fascinating process, served as a sweet excuse for the women and children of the neighbourhood to gather, chat and play while being curious spectators and quality monitors.\\n\\nThe art of kalai responded to the aspects of sustenance at various levels. Firstly, the practice required simple materials that were not exclusive to any zone, climate or source, making the procurement of ingredients fairly easy. Secondly, by employing itself on materials that had high-conductivity, it helped harness the full potential of the fuel, being sensitive in turn to the environment as well as the physical labour that went into collecting the firewood. Thirdly, by averting corrosion of the metal, the kitchenware lasted for decades without having their quality and strength compromised. This is drastically different from the vicious loop in which customers find themselves at present – that of – buying often and discarding often.  At the time, household objects were treated as investments and cultural practices like kalai, added to their longevity as well as value. Unfortunately, this no longer holds true.\\n\\nIt is evident that kalai and the kalai-wala remain relevant only as long as the society uses kitchenware made of copper and brass. Sadly, by the end of the 20th century, the newly minted republic of India leaned increasingly towards industrialization. And with this shift, the colour of an Indian kitchen changed from golds to greys. Aluminium and stainless steel came to represent the quintessential idea of a ‘modern’ home. ‘The allure of the ‘ever-silver’ aesthetic was strong enough to overshadow the fact that stainless steel neither conducted heat as well as copper nor retained heat as well as brass or cast iron. Yet, its easy maintenance was too compelling to ignore.’ [8]\\n\\nThis leaves us at a fascinating juncture. On a positive note, the aforementioned case helps us understand the aspects that we, as a community, appreciate and aspire for; on the other hand, it throws light on the costs that we, as a community, are willing to pay for ease and aesthetic.  \\n\\nA recent increase in awareness about the benefits associated with copper and brass has revived their use in part. While this new found awareness may be a step in the right direction, conversations circumventing the ills associated with their continued use are still lacking within the colloquial.  In the process of creating awareness about a subject, critical examination of the craft – its practice and not just the product is often left off the table, which leaves room for misinterpretation and missed opportunities. For instance, when the popular article cited in this essay applauds the artisans’ grit when working with grey-white opaque smoke, there must be space for concern and mitigation as much as appreciation.\\n\\n‘Mohammad Zeeshan claims that the fumes of the nausadar powder are not hazardous to health citing the health of his father and grandfather as examples. “Though as a precaution, our grandfather has instructed us to eat gud (jaggery) after work, a gharelu nuska (household remedy) to keep the lungs clean”, he states as a matter of fact.’ [8] Doctors with pulmonary expertise might disagree. It has also been noted that the vessel reaches a temperature of around 600oC – what precautions have been put in place to address that risk?\\n\\nBefore we proceed, we must go back to the first image and the impressions that came with it.  The art of kalai is dying, simply because its relevance has been ignored when focus shifted to convenience. Ironically, this convenience has come with the hidden fee of hefty medical bills, which if acknowledged and investigated may prompt a return to bronze-hued kitchens.\\n\\nCopper and brass utensils augmented by kalai protect and heal our body, our health, our investments and even our resources. They also have, for millennia, brought the community together. Modern design practices and designers should help kalaiwalas to interpret their craft for a modern consumer, and also work towards finding safer ways of practicing this craft.\\n\\nAnother learning is; adapt, not revert. Our education should equip us to empower these communities and involve them in our processes, instead of simply deferring current ‘solutions’ as a reaction to their forced irrelevance for years.\\n\\nAll these learnings should motivate us to stop and re-evaluate our preferences and priorities. We must re-visit and re-learn the beauty that lies in the simplicity of these practices. And most importantly, return to designing solutions that benefit people instead of a person. These practices prompt us to view design like silk, painfully delicate yet surprisingly strong.\\n\\nThe pungent fumes in the work place evince the downside of this work, the disturbing unnatural greened nails of the workers. The constant contact with acid, soda and these substances has the cording, roughening effect on the skin of their hands and their fingernails bear alarming testimony to the nature of their tasks. Such are the perilous hazards of this simple piece of work.\\n\\nHowever Haaji Nawabu is positive on the future of this trade though he admits that no one would want to take it up in the face of the negative effects, but if these are handled or done way with, maybe the process, if not modernized a bit cleansed for the workers, the health benefit, as promulgated by men of medicine, is sure to make it popular and expand the business. It is an intricate and beautiful little craft, worthy of protection.\\n\\nOn our pursuit to explore this distinct artistic work we reached out to Eram Sabi, a resident of the old city. After being asked about the different facets of this dying artistic work she says, “We still visit the Hakim in our area and his diagnosis and remedies always work. It was on his recommendation that we started using a copper jug for water. The kalai process employs Nausadar that is very good for digestion. So even in modern times we like to abide by these old world cures that are so easy and efficient”.\\n\\nCopper itself has many amazing benefits to offer. It has anti-microbial properties. Drinking water from a copper container is especially recommended. Skin disease such as vitiligo is combated by stimulated melanin production, aging can be reduced by the production of collagen, a connecting tissue, and anemia caused due to copper deficiency is also helped. But excess consumption can also be harmful to liver as balanced is beneficial to it, so one may consult a doctor before using copper utensils.\\n\\nIf we still continue to ignore all such artisan and their craftsmanship no doubt the art and science of Kalai and other fascinating art form of our childhood days might become extinct. So what we need to do is that we should utilize their traditional skills in new ways to generate fresh ideas and eye catching new products.\\n\\nThe house functioned like a well-oiled machine in those days with my Ba/Dadi at the helm of it all. Those were the days when the material pleasures weren’t in abundance nonetheless life was filled with immense joy and happiness. Life seemed to revolve around school, play and food. The air bustled with one or the other chore related to the food we were either stocking oil cans, getting the spices prepped and hand pounded, there were stacks of wheat-filled gunny bags almost 1000 kilos of it to feed our clan; wheat that had to be handpicked for impurities and coated with castor oil for the year-long storage, 13-14 varieties of pickles were made annually in summers so we were all snacking on raw mangoes, the winters had papad and wadi making sessions, potato wafers happened when new potatoes arrived in the markets. Then there were numerous other jobs like working with Saraniyaa to get the knives sharpened and get the brassware re-tinned. I remember requesting Ba to get the Kalai job done when we were home. Kalai is when we saw the magic happen, the dark and soiled looking brass pots and pans would magically turn shiny like new. Ba would always oblige and we would be part of that 2 hours of Kalai show. The workstation was set up under the Chikoo tree in our front yard. The brassware was brought in, the price negotiated and Ba would set-up her chair to monitor the entire process. Kalai is the process where brass and copper utensils used for cooking and eating are coated with a metal called Kalai. The Kalai coating fades with use and needs to be re-tinned after 6-8 months of usage. Brass and copper tend to react to souring agents in food and thus giving them a Kalai lining is a must.\\nBrass vessels were used for everyday cooking and eating in our family. It was a lot of hassle to keep them shiny every day. The ritual involving thorough cleaning was limited to twice-thrice a year when stored rainwater was used to wash the tamarind scrubbed vessels. Each vessel was dried thoroughly and allowed to soak in tender rays of pleasant winter sun. Summers were never meant for such tedious works. Gradually, with time we started stacking the brassware in lofts and trunks as steel and aluminium made way in the kitchen for the sheer ease it was to clean and maintain these utensils. As the use of brass decreased the need to call in the kalaiwala also decreased. Little did we realize that such lifestyle changes would drastically impair the livelihoods of our service providers. Once a regular ritual of witnessing the magic of Kalai was reduced to one every couple of years until it stopped completely. The Kalaiwala like many other traditional professions became a forgotten professional of a vanishing occupation.\\nThe journey of writing this blog gives me the much-needed opportunities to visit and understand the fading practices related to our kitchens be it the way we grow food, prepare food, cook food and all the peripheral things associated with food. As the wisdom to go back to the traditional practices prevails I was required to call kalaiwala to re-tin the brass inheritance I possess.\\nJagdishbhai is 5th generation Kalaiwala, who has been practising this craft for more than 45 years. I prefer to call all these traditional professions crafts because of the dextrous skills they require. Jagadishbhai learnt his craft from his father however his children have not taken up this profession hence he is the last amongst his generation to practice this craft. Working under the open sky in scorching 45 degrees C is a challenging task but he chose to do it with a smile on his face. The cost of raw materials nausadar (ammonium chloride) and Kalai have both become gone up in recent times. Kalai reaches India from Afghanistan where they have mines of this metal. Although the awareness on the use of brass, copper and Kansa is on the rise the profession is dying a slow death and isn’t enticing the younger generations. Jagdhishbhai talked at length about the benefits of using, brass that wears a kalai coated, hope and optimism about the rise of this occupation in coming times!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKATHAK IN LUCKNOW GHARANA:\\n\\n\\n\\nKathak is a classical Indian dance form that originated in the northern regions of India.

These fragrant concoctions are known for their delicate and long-lasting nature. Here\\'s a deep dive into the world of Lucknowi attars:\\n\\n**The Art of Lucknowi Attar**\\n\\nLucknowi attars are distinct for several reasons:\\n\\n* **Natural Ingredients:** Unlike synthetic perfumes, attars are made using natural ingredients like aromatic herbs, flowers, spices, sandalwood oil, musk, and essential oils. This results in unique and complex fragrances.\\n* **Delicate Extraction Methods:** Traditional methods involve meticulous techniques like steam distillation and solvent extraction to capture the essence of these natural ingredients.\\n* **Aging:**  Attars are often aged for months or even years to allow the fragrance to mature and develop its full depth.\\n\\n**Varieties of Lucknowi Attar**\\n\\nThe streets of Lucknow are lined with shops offering a delightful selection of attars:\\n\\n* **Floral Attars:** Rose (Gulab), Jasmine (Champa), Mogra (Mogra), Keora (Kewra) are popular choices, offering a sweet and refreshing aroma.\\n\\n* **Woody Attars:**  Sandalwood (Chandan) and Oud (Agar) attars are prized for their warm, musky, and earthy scents.\\n\\n* **Exotic Attars:**  Unique options include Mitti attar (earthy fragrance), Khus attar (vetiver, known for its cooling properties), and Zafran attar (saffron, with a delicate and spicy aroma).\\n\\n\\n**The Lucknowi Attar Experience**\\n\\nAttar application in Lucknow goes beyond just a fragrance. Here\\'s a glimpse into the experience:\\n\\n* **Attar Dab**:  Traditionally, attars are stored in beautiful hand-painted glass bottles called ittardans. A small amount is applied using a slender glass rod called an attar dab.\\n\\n* **Fragrance Matching:**  Skilled attar vendors can assess your preferences and suggest attars that complement your personality.\\n\\n**Where to Find Lucknowi Attar**\\n\\nTo experience the true essence of Lucknowi attars, visit these iconic Lucknow markets:\\n\\n* **Aminabad Bazar:** A bustling marketplace known for its wide variety of attar shops.\\n* **Chowk:**  Another historic market where you can find generations-old attar perfumeries.\\n\\n**Beyond the Markets:**\\n\\nHere are some reputed Lucknowi attar brands:\\n\\n* Moid Ali & Son\\'s Perfumers (Lucknow Chowk)\\n* Izharson Perfumers (Hazratganj)\\n* Sugandhco (Trilok Nath Road)\\n\\nThese stores offer high-quality attars and often have a rich heritage in the art of attar making.\\n\\nWhether you\\'re seeking a personal fragrance or a unique souvenir, Lucknowi attars offer a captivating and authentic experience. Immerse yourself in the fragrant traditions of Lucknow and discover the perfect attar to suit your taste!\\n\\nThe city of Lucknow is known for its fine perfumes that are available in beautiful bottles of cut-glass work. Perfumers in Lucknow make delicate and lasting fragrances using various aromatic herbs, spices, sandal oil, musk, essence of flowers, and leaves. Attar, derived from Persian word \\'atr\\' means fragrance. Perfumes or attars have been in use in Lucknow since the 19th century. During the days of the nawabs, perfumes were also added to food to enhance the taste and aroma of the dish. It is said that Mughal empress, Nur Jahan, would bathe in water perfumed by rose water, thus encouraging people to start extracting scented oil from the flower. \\n\\nLegend has it that the practice of using natural substances to derive scents came from ascetics who would burn roots and other plant material during their meditative bonfires. The sweet smells lingered for a while, inspiring nearby villagers to experiment with flowers to find the right tones. Once they had attars down to a science, the villagers started presenting these fragrances to the nawabs, who would spray the halls and walkways of the palaces before the arrival of guests. Since attar also has therapeutic properties, when sprayed in public spaces, it would subtly put visitors at ease.  \\n\\nUnlike their synthetic counterparts, attars are meant to be applied directly to the skin, and last much longer. They are organic in nature, and therefore more sustainable than artificial scents. You can pick traditional and famous fragrances like khus, keora, chameli, zafran and agar from the markets in Aminabad or Chowk. \\n\\n\\n\\nLUCKNOW LITERARY FESTIVAL:\\n\\n\\nThe Lucknow Literary Festival is an initiative of LUCKNOW Society that acknowledges new literary talents, honors our legends, while restoring literary tradition of the past, Lucknow’s own unique heritage and also evoking the newer generation’s interest.

It is held each year in Lucknow, during the month of February/March, and celebrates excellence in Indian and International writing.[2]\\n\\nAs one among the top 6 literary festival in India, as stated by Outlook magazine,[3] It brings together some of the greatest thinkers and writers from across the world.

These people may belong to various fields like Hindi writing, Urdu writing, Journalism, Social service etc. These eminent personalities belong to Lucknow and even across India respectively.\\n\\nLucknow, the city renowned for its adaa and tehzeeb has nurtured some of the finest personalities, most of whom went on to make a name globally. Some, however, continued to be unsung heroes working behind the scenes to carve their niche. Lucknow Society in its third edition of the Lucknow Literary Festival 2015 bestowed four eminent personalities with awards for excellence in their respective field. These awardees belong to Lucknow or have some kind of association with the city and brought it glory. They might have migrated to other parts of the globe but nevertheless they remain proud possessions of Lucknow and both city and they are proud to be a Lucknowite. Though the award is just another number for them as they have already been conferred with numerous accolades previously, nevertheless we hope it boosts their enthusiasm and serves as a token of appreciation for them.\\n\\nLucknow Literary Festival bestowed Wajid Ali Shah award to legendary Kathak exponent Pandit Birju Maharaj. Named after last Nawab of Lucknow, the award was bestowed to Maharaj ji as he has made a great contribution in order to keep the art alive. He was born as Brijmohan Mishra to a noted Kathak exponent, Jagannath Maharaj, popularly known as Acchan Maharaj. His father served as a court dancer in Raigarh princely state. Trained by his uncles, Lachhu Maharaj and Shambhu Maharaj and his father, Birju Maharaj exhibited his talent at the tender age of seven and became a legend in the Lucknow gharana of Kathak dance. Credit goes to him for taking kathak to its previously unattained zenith. Pandit Birju Maharaj served as the director of the Kathak Kala Kendra for several years. He took to teaching kathak at a very young age and later founded his own dance school, Kalashram which imparts training to aspiring dancers. Though kathak remains his first love, very few know that he is trained in Hindustani classical music too. He has composed the music, and sang, for two dance sequences in the Satyajit Ray’s Shatranj ke Khilari, and choreographed the song Kaahe Chhed Mohe from the 2002 film version of movie Devdas. The Government of India conferred on him the Padma Vibhushan Award, Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and the Kalidas Samman. In 2012, he was bestowed with the National Award for Best Choreography for the film Vishwaroopam.\\n\\nThe Lucknow Literary Festival and so its audience was indeed fortunate to have been graced by Pandit Birju Maharaj. The presentation screen at the festival showcasing old video clips, which showed him dancing and imparting kathak lessons to audience evoked a sense of nostalgia and pride among his fans. In the heart-to-heart interaction with the audience, Pandit Birju Maharaj said he was overjoyed to have won the award. He also expressed his desire for the revamping of his old ancestral home Kalka Bindadin Maharaj ji ki Dyodhi at Lucknow into a heritage spot. It is relevant to mention here that the government of Uttar Pradesh has ordered a grant for the restoration of his ancestral property in Lucknow. Pandit Birju Maharaj wishes to establish a kathak training school at his ancestral home with due support from the government. He also expressed concern at the eroding tehzeeb in Lucknow and stressed the need to revive performing arts in the city.\\n\\nBesides Wajid Ali Shah award, the Pride of Lucknow awards were conferred on three distinguished luminaries.\\n\\nShiv Murti - Pride Of Lucknow Award\\n\\nThe Pride of Lucknow award for the contribution to Hindi literature was bestowed on author Shiv Murti. Born on March 11, 1950, Shiv Murti is one of the leading voices in contemporary Hindi fiction. Hailing from humble background, his life was full of struggle. But the best steel is made when iron is passed in hottest temperature. This holds true for author Shiv Murti. A person of few words, he let his works do the talking for him. His first story ‘Mujhe Jeena Hai’ followed by ‘Paanphool’ was published when he was studying in 12th standard. Thereafter he never looked back. His works depict the plight of rural folk in true light. Caste politics, power politics, poverty and Dalit problems form the theme of his works. One of his best novels ‘Triyacharitra’ portrays the life of a young girl who is false implicated for having an illicit relationship and as a consequence has to bear the brutal punishment handed out by gram panchayat. This novel was later made into a movie by Basu Chatterjee. Since his works paint a picture of rural life in true fervor, his fans consider him as second Premchand. But he brushes aside this compliment saying: “Premchand is Premchand. I can never replace him.” His other novels are Trishul and Tarpan. Keshar Kasturi is a collection of stories authored by him. Now his fans should gear up for the re- release of his novel ‘Akhiri Chhalang’. Shivmurti has won Kathakram and Hans award in the past. Though he is satisfied with the kind of Hindi works produced today, he expresses concern at the youngsters losing interest in Hindi literature.\\n\\nMadhvi Kuckreja - Pride Of Lucknow Award\\n\\nThe Pride of Lucknow award for excellence in women empowerment was bestowed on Madhvi Kuckreja, a social worker and founder of NGO Vanaangan. Humbled to receive the award, she considers herself fortunate to have won it though she had shifted her base to Lucknow only few years back. She has set up a shop, Sanatkada here that sells handicrafts, functions as a café, a book club and a film club, all rolled into one. Madhvi has supported numerous women-led, grassroots-level organizations to emerge as transparent, vibrant entities that are sensitive to women. Internationally, she has worked on building opinion against women being subjected to violence in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka and Sudan. Before moving to Lucknow, she was earlier working in Bundelkhand for alleviating the problems of Dalit women, who are entangled in triad of poverty, caste discrimination and gender subjugation. Though they have been financially independent for long, Dalit women are subjected to discrimination and violence in all forms manifesting itself through rape, public humiliation, or honor killings. Another common punishment for breaking community rules that is also used simply for vengeance is public stripping and parading of women. Violence can also take an extreme form with lynching of women labeled as witches or dayans. Domestic violence however, cuts through religious, caste and class boundaries-dowry related death caused by “accidental” burning of women thrives in the state. Moreover, when women gain property rights-usually after being widowed-they become targets of violence by members of the family or community. Therefore, instead of being economically empowering, property is itself a reason for violence against women. She expresses satisfaction that Due to the collective efforts of her NGO, knowledge levels among Dalit women have increased and they are assuming leadership roles in the village community.\\n\\nAnis Ashfaq - Pride Of Lucknow Award\\n\\nThe third Pride of Lucknow award was conferred on noted Urdu author Anees Ashfaq. His work ‘Dukhyare’ highlighting his close relationship with elder brother carries the undertones of declining affluent culture of Lucknow. Elated though to receive the award, he considers ‘Qalam’ as his biggest award. “My writings are useless until they fail to strike a chord with genuine readers,” he said on his felicitation. So what make him pursue writing in Urdu? “I was an avid reader at the age of 18-19. Credit goes to my mother for imparting me lessons in Urdu and shaping my language as it is today.” He expresses concern at the declining habit of reading in today’s youngsters and their overriding ambitions to become stars overnight. He, however, lauds the initiative of Lucknow Society and stresses such rendezvous should be encouraged as they serve as a platform to bring genuine writers together and instills awareness among people. His writings reflect genuine critical analysis of the contemporary scenario. He believes that writings on Lucknow today are not portraying it in true light. With his desire for cultural revival of the city, his upcoming next novel is also set in Lucknow.\\n\\nWith conferring of these four awards, honouring of the dignitaries at the festival came to an end. We at Lucknow Society are thrilled to award best of talent in the city and will continue to reward blossoming excellence in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMARSIYA AND MANASAVI:\\n\\n\\nMarsiya and Masnavi:  Beyond ghazals, Lucknow was known for its marsiya (elegies) commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Hussain and his companions\\n\\nMir Babbar Ali Anees popularly known as ‘Shayar-e Azam’ is the king of marsiya, or elegy in Urdu poetry. Along with his contemporary, Mirza Salamat Ali Dabir, his style of writing the marsiya reached its zenith in Lucknow.\\n\\nMarsiya is a poetic form focused on the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain in the seventh century along with 72 companions in the Battle of Karbala in modern day Iraq.\\n\\nMir-Anees-Stamp\\n\\nAnees was a born poet and his talent for poetry was inherited by him from his grandfather, Mir Hasan, a celebrated poet of the masnavi style. His father Mir Khaliq was also a poet and Anees was very proud of his poetic ancestry.\\n\\nAnees started writing ghazals in Faizabad where he was born under the pseudonym Hazin, or treasurer but in Lucknow he changed his name to Anees.\\n\\nThis takhallus, or pseudonym is said to be a gift from Iman Baksh Nasikh, a great composer of ghazal who died in Lucknow in 1838 when Anees was in his mid 30s. Nasikh had predicted a bright future for Anees and his charming style of reciting verse.\\n\\nHis contribution to Urdu language is tremendous, for Anees is responsible for polishing and refining the language and filling his compositions with remarkable sweetness, elegance and freshness.\\n\\nThe vocabulary at his command was vast and he used words with great thought and grace. He added many new words.\\n\\nPure Urdu\\nThe Urdu of Anees is considered authoritative by scholars from Lucknow and Delhi and his family was aptly called the custodian of the pure Urdu idiom. Anees provides an epic element to Urdu literature. He perfected the old theme and added new ones in the marsiya he wrote. He was a master painter of scenes of nature in all its moods. These descriptions of nature are not independent but always immersed into the main theme by the poet. Anees was a master of understanding and capturing human emotions and interpreting them into verse. Feelings of joy and sorrow, anger, love, jealously, envy, fear, are all portrayed in a superb style by him that is very moving.\\n\\nRare picture of Mir Anees reciting Marsiya at Nawab Thaver Jung Bahadur\\'s residence in Hyderabad\\nRare picture of Mir Anees reciting Marsiya at Nawab Thaver Jung Bahadur’s residence in Hyderabad\\n\\nThe description of battle-fields, fights, marches, counter- marches, challenges, the weapons used are brought to life, leaving a very vivid and powerful impression on the reader. For his kind of writing, Anees enjoyed an enviable reputation during his lifetime as well and which remains unchallenged to this day.\\n\\nRare picture of Mir Anees at Nawab Thaver Jung Bahadur\\' residence in Hyderabad\\nRare picture of Mir Anees at Nawab Thaver Jung Bahadur’ residence in Hyderabad\\n\\nIndia’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru always read Anees on the 10th day of Mohurram throughout his life. According to Shibli Nomani, Islamic scholar from the early 20th century, no other poet has such a lush vocabulary at his command as Anees, including poets writing in other languages apart from Urdu. That is why his rich poetic qualities remain unmatched by any other poet.\\n\\nJosh Malihabadi, famous Urdu poet who died in 1982, pays rich tribute to Anees in verse:\\n\\n“Teri Har Mauj-e Nafas Rooh-ul Ameen Ki Jaan Hai, Tu Meri Urdu Zubaan Ka Bolta Quran Hai”\\n\\nNeglect\\nMir-Anees-Haveli\\nMir Anees Haveli\\n\\nThe fame of Anees continues to rise as more people get interested in Urdu literature. According to Shamsur Rahman Faruqi, poet and leading Urdu critic and theorist, the marsiya of Anees is the best example of narrative-historical, narrative-lyrical, and oral-dramatic poetry in pre-modern Urdu. Dr Sharib Rudaulvi, retired professor, Centre of Indian Languages, Jawaharlal Nehru University adds that the poetry of Anees is a glowing representation of the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb of Lucknow.\\n\\n“Khana Hai, Na Peena Hai, Na Rahat Hai, Na Sona Hai, Hai Khaakh Ka Farsh Aur, Na Takiya Na Bichona Hai”\\n\\nAnees did not leave Lucknow till the takeover of Avadh by the British in 1856. He felt that his art would not be appreciated outside Lucknow but circumstances forced him to earn a living elsewhere. In 1859, and again in 1860 he went to Patna. He transited in Varanasi on his return after the second journey. He visited Hyderabad in 1871 and stopped at Allahabad to recite his marsia in the Imambara of Lala Beni Prasad Srivastava who was a devotee of Hazrat Imam Hussain before an audience of thousands. Whenever Anees recited in Lucknow, large crowds of people would collect to hear him.\\n\\nAnees died in Lucknow in 1874 and lies buried near his house in a locality known as ‘Kucha-e Mir Annes’ in the old city.\\n\\nIndia is not only a melting pot but a salad brawl, which manifests equally in grief and sorrow. The Muharram is the one that is being observed with religious-cultural ethos. Many traditions and customs that enriched India today have come from Persia during the Mughal era – some also before it – giving birth to the observations such as Taziyadari and Marsiyakhwani, making the country a synthesis of culture.\\n\\nMarsiyakhwani, the meaning, and the background\\n\\nThe term Marsiya is a derivative of the Arabic ‘Risa’, which means praising the dead in a funeral oration, weeping and wailing over the deceased. Marsiya, generally speaking, is an elegy recited to express sorrow on the death of a person. But it has been symbolized by the commemoration of the martyrdom of Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) grandson, Imam Hussain. The form of Urdu Marsiya is only related to this only as it has been observed in the Indian subcontinent but now it is recited across the world. Imam Hussain and His family including his 6-month-old son were martyred in the month of Muharram, Marsiya used to be mainly recited by Shia Muslims only. Other sects of the Muslim community and even Hindu poets also adopted this form of Marsiya in their poetry.\\n\\nMarsiya evolved in two different techniques; one is Tahtul Lafz means in spoken form without the use of musical notes like Sa Re Ga Ma. The legendary Marsiyakhwan who made this art famous, Mir Anees recited Tahtul Lafz Marsiya in which he used his hands to express the particular event. Another form started gaining popularity in Majalis (mourning ceremonies) which were recited by the people with good soulful voices i.e. Sozkhwani.\\n\\nMarsiya was a Persian literary tradition, it molded with its uniqueness in India when many Persian poets and scholars came here. Marsiya first developed in the Deccan as a form of folk poetry. As an audience-oriented literary tradition it changed following the social environment and patronage patterns, and in this process absorbed many traits of oral epic rendition. The theatrical arts of Indian and Persian origin also influenced it considerably, and thus Marsiya represented the synthesis of multiple cultural traditions. It assimilated the traits of both classical canonized forms and folk musical varieties and developed from Khwanandagi (chanting) into a most sophisticated musical style – the Sozkhwani.\\n\\nMarsiya as a well-defined literary form existed in Arabic literature in pre-Islamic days (Daur-i Jahili) and many poets such as Muhalhil Taghlabi (c. 531 AD) and Khamsa shaira (44 A.H.) contributed to the ‘Risa’ poetry. However, this tradition is much older in Iran and may be traced to the literary and musical conventions of pre-Islamic ancient Persia. Sog-i Siyawash (mourning of Siyawash, Cyrus, the father of Kai Khusrau) and Marg-i Zarir (the death of Zarir, brother of Gushtasp) figure most in the tales (asatir) of bygone days. Some stories (dastan) and poetic verses are still extant in Pahlavi, reminiscent of the legacy of the ancient Persians. Sog-i Siyawashan is a famous melody (ahang) of a sombre nature that prompts us to cry.\\n\\nMarsiya in Urdu was first written in the 16th century in South India, in the kingdoms of Golconda and Bijapur which were Shiite kingdoms. This form found an especially congenial soil in Lucknow, an important Shia Muslim community in the Indian subcontinent, where it was regarded as an act of piety and religious duty to eulogize and bemoan the martyrs of the battle of Karbala. The genre was championed by Mir Babar Ali Anees.\\n\\nTalking to India News Stream about this art, famous Marsiyakhwan of Lucknow and Urdu litterateur Qazi Asad said, “The Art of Tahtul Lafz Marsiya Khwani is the recitation of Urdu Epics & Elegies based on the Tragedy of Imam Hussain in Karbala in a Declaratory form with the obvious usage of voice, eyes, hands, etc. to let the audience understand and feel different emotions of every Stanza of the Elegy which is mostly comprised of six verses.”\\n\\nFundamentals of Marsiyakhwani\\n\\nMarsiya generally consists of six-line units, with a rhyming quatrain, and a couplet on a different rhyme.\\n\\nIt is characterized by six-line verses in an AA, AA, and BB rhyme scheme. They are traditionally either recited by Marsiya-Khwans or sung by a Sozkhwan.\\n\\nHistorian Rana Safvi writes in her blog, “A classical Urdu Marsiya usually includes most of the following sections: a prelude (Chehrah) of poems of praise, descriptions of the morning or night before the battle, a general introduction to the hardships faced by Hussein; a description of the poem’s hero — whether Hussein or one of his companions — and his virtues; the leave-taking or departure for the battlefield (Rukhsat); the entry onto the field (Aamad); a declaration of the hero’s martial prowess (Rajaz); the battle (Jang); the martyrdom (Shahadat); and finally, the lament (Bain). To this one could add the topical focus (Maajrah) and the prayer (Dua).”\\n\\nFamous marsiya writers in Urdu include Mir Babar Ali Anis, Mirza Salamat Ali Dabeer, Ali Haider Tabatabai, Najm Afandi, Josh Malihabadi, and others. Well-known Persian poets of the genre include Muhtasham Kashani, Nawab Ahmad Ali Khan Qayamat, and Samet Borujerdi. In Turkish, Bâkî composed an important Marsiya.\\n\\nMir Babar Ali Anes, a renowned Urdu poet, composed salāms, elegies, Nauhas, and quatrains. While the length of the elegy initially had no more than forty or fifty stanzas, he pushed it beyond one hundred fifty or even longer than two hundred stanzas or bands, as each unit of Marsiya in the ‘Musaddas’(six liners) format is known. Mir Anees drew upon the vocabulary of Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Hindi, and Awadhi to a great degree. He has become an essential element of Muharram among the Urdu speakers of the Indian subcontinent. The first major and still current critical articulation about Mir Anis was Muazna-e-Anis-o-Dabir (1907) written by Shibli Nomani in which he said “the poetic qualities and merits of Anis are not matched by any other poet”.\\n\\nAnother important Marsiya poet was Chhannu Lal Dilgeer who was born during the reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah. He was initially a ghazal poet with the ‘takhallus’ (pen name) ‘Tarab’, before focusing on Marsiya at a later stage. He converted to Islam and changed his name to Ghulam Hussain. His most popular marsiya is ‘Ghabrayegi Zainab’, which is currently being recited in houses during Ashura i.e. 10th Muharram.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOPEN MICS IN LUCKNOW:\\n\\n\\nOpen mics in lucknow are occupying good space on the events calendar in Lucknow. As a multi-cultural city, Lucknow was always the culture capital of India ever since the era of the Kings and the Nawabs. Music, dance and poetry (sher-o-shayari) reached their peak under royal patronage. Even today, Lucknow occupies an important place as the center for music, poetry, plays, dance and design among many other things. It comes as no surprise that Lucknowites take immense pride in the city’s cultural legacy.\\n\\nBut as the society progressed, people began to move away from art and literature towards the modern entertainment avenues. The traditional literary art forms have faced a lot of neglect in the past but it is due to their unbeatable charm that they seem to have gotten a new lease of life. Albeit slowly, but Lucknow and its people have embraced the growing trend of open mic sessions, which have become a regular feature in the evolving café culture in the city.\\n\\nThese events are focused on performing arts like poetry, spoken word, music and stand-up comedy and bring together professionals and amateur talent with an audience that is willing to accept and listen. In Lucknow, there was never a dearth of gifted individuals but what it lacked was suitable platforms, which forced people to move out to the bigger cities, in search of a stage that would allow them to showcase their talent.\\n\\nOpen mics in Lucknow and the Impact\\nOpen mics in Lucknow encourage people from different walks of life share their original work or even the work of their favourite authors and poets. Not everyone who writes is comfortable performing in public but being in the company of a like-minded, warm and unbiased audience often acts as a catalyst to encourage people to write more.\\n\\nThe beauty of open-mics lies in the fact that no session can be re-created. Every session is unique in its way and thus the audience can expect something different in every event. A lot of places that organise these open-mics usually follow a theme, which provides different perspectives to a topic. They create a social space where performers are able to polish their skills and individuals, especially youngsters are encouraged to express themselves through writing and poetry. To add to it, the laid back and serene atmosphere serves as the perfect setting to inspire creativity.\\n\\nIt is not just the cafes and performers that have benefitted from the growing open mic culture. Organisers as young as school students are seen arranging various sessions of open mics on a weekly basis. This not only inculcates creativity, responsibility and appreciation for art but also hones their skills and personality.\\n\\nIn Lucknow, there are many groups dedicated to reviving the poetry and literature culture in the city by organising regular open-mics. Some of them are:\\n\\nMukhaatib Foundation:\\nMukhaatib is a poetry group that welcomes those who share their passion for Urdu literature and poetry. They routinely organise poetic evenings / mushairas in the presence of famous Urdu poets of Lucknow, and organise workshops & open mics for the youth / new and budding poets of the city. Their workshops include the basics of Urdu language, classification of Urdu poetry and the basics of Urdu Ghazal. There is even a question-answer round to clarify any doubts or queries on the nuances and finer aspects or Urdu poetry.\\n\\nThe Poetry Club, Lucknow:\\nThe Poetry Club (TPC) is a community that gives budding poets and writers a chance to connect with others who share their love for words. Regarded as one of the best open mics in Lucknow, they provide a comfortable and warm setting for literature lovers to exchange poetry and showcase their work.\\n\\nThe Writer’s Hub:\\nThe Writer’s Hub believes that writing is a medium to emote our thoughts, emotions and imagination. Welcoming writers from all across, their motto is “You write, We Share.” They regularly hold open mics in Lucknow and organise workshops to help young talent find the way in the mesmerizing world of literature.\\n\\nLiterature and poetry are not just art forms. Open Mics in Lucknow showcase the cultural significance and are a part of the identity that the city holds today. One major reason for the decline of the literary art is the fading interest of the new generation. Thus, it becomes all the important to hold such open mic events in Lucknow where youngsters are encouraged to explore accept their culture so that art is not only preserved but revived to its former glory. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nREPERTWAHR FESTIVAL:\\n\\n\\nConceived in 2009, Repertwahr started life as a small theatre festival in the city of Lucknow. It was the coming together of a few passionate individuals who wanted to change the face of Lucknow theatre of the time.\\n\\nHelmed by Bhoopesh Rai and Priyanka Sarkar, the festival soon gained a steady following amongst the theatre and art lovers of the city. The festival kept surpassing its own benchmarks, year after year. It soon added Music and Stand-up comedy to its performance genres amidst a stupendous response from the starved-for-quality-content audience of Lucknow.\\n\\nThe quality of its content, the vibrant, festive ambiance and the seamless execution of the festival has led to the Repertwahr festival blossoming into one of India\\'s most unique celebrations of performing arts.\\n\\nOver the years, Repertwahr has organically evolved into a crack production team that hosts niche events, produces awesome video content and runs clutter -breaking campaigns for its clients.\\n\\nBhoopesh and Priyanka are also the founder trustees of the Repertwahr Foundation, which has been working to promote performing arts in general and theatre in particular, in the smaller towns of the country, with a special focus on the state of Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nRepertwahr Festival is one of the most unique Lucknow theatre festival which actively promotes music, films and theatre in Lucknow featuring best talents.\\n\\nThis was long overdue. And yes we have kept you waiting long enough. But as they say, better late than never, here we are. It fills us with immense pride and no small amount of anxiety as we put together the 8th season of the celebration that is The Repertwahr Festival. With the Repertwahr blog, we hope to start a dialogue with you and provide you with the inside scoop on the festival, the team behind it and the performances that are in store for you this season.\\n\\nStarted in the year 2009, The Repertwahr Festival has set its own benchmarks, year after year. From its humble beginnings, the festival has grown up to be the most marquee festival on the city’s cultural calendar. Every year, we bring together some of India’s biggest and the best performing artists under one roof to make it a week-long celebration of art unlike any other.\\n\\nRepertwahr Festival was born out of a zeal to change the way art is perceived in the city. A team of like-minded friends came together and put up a 5-day Theatre Festival in Lucknow, hoping against hope to that the city is going to appreciate their efforts. The very first day was heartbreaking as a total of 50 people turned up to watch our very first show. But before we could lose our faith, the word spread about the festival and our 3rd show became houseful. The rest, as they say, is history.\\n\\nWe haven’t looked back since. Over the course of last 7 years, Repertwahr Festival has grown to become one of the biggest theatre & music festivals in India. Last year we hosted more than 150 artists from all over the country to perform in front of our appreciative audience. Till date, Repertwahr has hosted 78 super successful shows featuring some of India’s biggest, brightest talents on stage.\\n\\nThe soulful evenings turn social before and after every performance. The team works really hard to make the audience experience as seamless, festive and artistic as we possibly can. The fest mirrors the tireless efforts of the team right from the entrance of the location, the decor, the ambience and the lineup of artists on stage.\\n\\nIn 2014, Repertwahr first dabbled in music as a performance genre. It debuted with a single Manganiyar troupe presenting their folksy tunes while the audience waited for the theatre show to start. Now, 20 amazing shows later, Repertwahr’s music stage commands a following of its own.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZARBULAND WORK:\\n\\n\\nThe charm and richness of the heritage of the historic city of Lucknow have been the characteristic of the city since ages. The royal culture, cuisine and craft, all deserve a special mention for being the highlight of the city. During all these years, Lucknow has not only carried the lineage forward but has also accepted newer things with open arms.\\n\\nBidri is one such craft that has its roots of origination in the state of Karnataka but now it is an inherent art form practiced widely in Lucknow. The city provided the art form with a flourishing ground with many local craftsmen who readily adopted the unique form of craft in their works. Bidri work supports the livelihood of hundreds of craftsmen today and is an integral part of the city’s art and craft culture.\\n\\nThe exquisite bidri and zarbuland (similar to bidri but slightly different) handicrafts can be seen adorning the rooms of Lucknowites or as classy cutlery in many households of Lucknow. The metallic craft is exquisite and involves a complex process to transform a few pieces of metal into a dainty marvel. To have a closer look at the art form, continue reading our vivid detailing on it.\\n\\nLucknow and its relation with the craft\\n\\nLucknow city has always been an ardent promoter of craft be it the Chikankari, Zardozi or Bidriware and Zarbuland. The art form found a foothold in the city during the rule of the Nawabs. The Nawabs were fond of the craft and supported it which eventually resulted in the setting up of various centres of the art form. In fact Zarbuland, which is a variant of Bidriware, got more prominence in the city of Nawabs. Today you can easily find Bidri and Zarbuland work on trays, bowls, hookah base (Huqqah Farshi), jewel boxes, cigarette holders and many other decorative articles as well. The art that was encouraged decades ago by the Nawabs of Awadh, is now an important feature of the city, and forms a vital part of the livelihood of many local artisans.\\n\\nWhat exactly is Bidriware?\\n\\nBidriware got its name after the place of its origination which is Bidar in Karnataka. The craft was introduced in India by the Bahamani Sultans and is believed to have been traditionally invented in Persia several centuries ago. Bidriware includes damascening which is the craft of coating one metal with another through undercutting and hammering. The process is difficult and intricate but the finished product is beautiful, full of sheen and shine.\\n\\nThe gleam, which Bidriware has, is its highlight as it is done on the lustrous surface of the shiny metals, including the silver inlaying. A Bidriware goes through the long process of molding, polishing, carving, inlaying and darkening of the alloy to jet black for the silver design to look more appealing. The process includes use of mixture of copper and zinc in the ratio of 1:16 along with other non-ferrous metals that don’t rust on exposure to moisture. The designs are inlaid with fine wires or strips of silver that look beautiful in contrast against the black surface of the Bidriware.\\n\\nZarbuland: A Variation of Bidriware\\n\\nZarbuland can be said to be Bidriware with a difference. Zarbuland developed early in Lucknow and became very popular owing to the beautiful creativity and innovation. Zarbuland actually looks similar to the Tanjore metal work plates with certain differences. The characteristic feature of the Zarbuland that differentiates it from Bidri is that the designs in Zarbuland are raised above the surface. In Zarbuland, unlike Bidri, the inlaying of silver is done after the pattern is carved on the silver sheet. Zarbuland is an exquisite form of artistry native to Lucknow that has added to the creative facet of the Lucknow city.\\n\\nDesigns in Lucknow Bidri and Zarbuland\\n\\nThe designs practiced in Bidriware and Zarbuland in Lucknow are floral, vine creepers, fruits, fish designs, hunting scenes, animals, birds and anything inspired from nature. Nature was the primary muse for the workers that continues to inspire the artisans even today. A typical design comprises of human figures, flora, and fauna that look beautiful on a Zarbuland artifact or Bidriware.\\n\\nThe craft is complex and difficult to make but the finished product is a sheer beauty to adore. The shining silver designs on the glossy surface appear attractive to the eyes and are a class apart.\\n\\nThe art form has received acceptance and adulation from both Lucknowites and visitors. The craft needs more support and stimulus to survive the completion in the market. So when in Lucknow, do not miss out on this exquisite art form, widely seen on hookahs, ughaaldaans, jewelry boxes and other decorative household items.\\n\\nZar Buland\\'s work was developed in Lucknow district in Uttar Pradesh.

A large number of artisans engaging in Zardozi or Chikankari are employed in the trade of developing beautiful embroidery on a variety of textile material.\\n\\nZardozi and Chikankari are among the most iconic forms of embroidery that continue to represent Lucknow City on the World fashion map. A renowned scholar on Arts and Culture once said, “Hand occupies only second place after brain in terms of cultural evolution.” To this date, handmade artifacts are sole witnesses that teach us about the cultural evolution of human civilization. As time progressed, each of the art forms that employed handiwork became sole representatives of the indigenous cultures. It is through these art forms that we are usually introduced to these cultures by virtue of these handmade artifacts.\\n\\nHowever, while Zardozi continues to wow the world of owing to its exquisite and brilliant feel, the very hands that create this magic find themselves struggling for a decent livelihood today. Men and Women behind this centuries old fine craft unfortunately, haven’t even got the recognition they deserved. As a result, the newer generations are shying away from getting into the hereditary trade as they call it.\\n\\nZardozi artists even since Mughal period have committed themselves and their generations to keep this precious art alive. Today, they feel they are denied their rights to be a part of mainstream owing to the economic status, which again stems from the unfair working conditions as well as miniscule wages that they receive as their remuneration for dedicating their lives. What is even more remorseful is the apathy that these artisans face from all quarters be it industrialists, businessmen, or political leaders.\\n\\nA wonderful movie on the state of Zardozi artisan community has been produced by FEED (Federation of Education and Economic Development).\\n\\nThis movie seeks to find and address ground root level situation of Zardozi workers in Lucknow City.\\n\\nWhile the Government of India has always been pretty active towards the cause of recognition and upliftment of handicrafts of India, Zardozi workers somehow have always felt short in receiving the benefits extended to them. Officials and retailers often attribute this trend to the laid-back attitude of these artisans, however that is rather a partial observation.\\n\\nIn cultural terms, community of Zardozi artisans has always comprised highly self-reliant, and motivated individuals who love their trade as much as their self-esteem. There has always been a tendency among the artists to stay aloof from the worldliness and remain committed to their work. Zardozi artisans too like any other artist community know their worth, and thus do not indulge into securing their livelihood through lobbying or staging sit-ins.\\n\\nAny related governing bodies must ensure that approaching any artist community must be a task well guided by intent as well as respect for them as well as their craft. It is only then that the state of that craft will heal. Another discouraging fact is that this disgruntled community of Zardozi artisans is often exploited by their local politicians at the times of elections for legislative houses and assemblies. Lack of education as well as lack of well-deserved facilities paves the way for them to be misled by those promising them the moon they have always craved for.\\n\\nSadly enough, the problem faced by Zardozi artists exceeds the number of one. In fact, the issues faced can be categorized separately, indicating that in order to uplift the state of Zardozi workmanship, much more than a relief package is required.\\n\\nThe process of developing Zardozi embroidery, involves mounting of the textile material onto a wooden frame, usually a feet and half from floor level. The artisans then, equipped with special needles and sequin materials, sit down on the floor surrounding the frame. Usually it is a 12-hour straight schedule for them, which takes a heavy toll on their backbones often culminating in severe orthopaedic disorders.\\n\\nBesides, poor lighting conditions also take a heavy toll on their eyesight.\\n\\nReports say that cases like these have forced some of the best hands at work to retire early enough, thus putting their financial independence under peril.\\n\\nZardozi artisans must be covered under occupational hazard initiatives by both Government as well as NGOs. This must include training to adopt safety guidelines as well as ensure healthcare for those adversely affected.\\n\\nAnother issue that Zardozi artisans face regularly comes from within the Zardozi artisan community. Overwhelmed by the artistic ego perhaps and their once legendary status, Zardozi artists are often found lacking in contemporary business practices such as innovation, time line guided deliveries, looking for new opportunities etc.\\n\\nThe State Government, in this case, should provide training and necessary infrastructure for them to understand the business dynamics vis-a-vis their perspectives as well as try to inculcate healthy professional practices among them. This might not only motivate them to bring improvement in their work process, who knows we might also witness fabulous innovations in the design and quality parameters.\\n\\nAlso, as we speak of training and upgrading work processes of Zardozi artisans, we also need to review the remuneration amounts and other amenities as per the current industry standards.\\n\\nConsidering the fact that Zardozi currently finds itself as the most desirable piece of ownership in the ethnic fashion circle for women all around the world, it will be real irony and grave injustice to ignore the hands that produce such a beautiful craft.\\n\\n\\n\\nTERRACOTTA JEWELLERY:\\n\\n\\nLucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh,  is known for its rich cultural heritage and traditional crafts. One such craft that has been practiced for centuries in Lucknow is terracotta jewelry making.\\n\\nTerracotta jewelry is a type of handmade jewelry made from clay that has been fired at high temperatures.

It is esteemed as one of India\\'s finest cities, boasting a unique culture characterized by emotional warmth, sophistication, courtesy, and a penchant for gracious living. This cultural richness, famously known as \"Lucknowi Tehzeeb,\" is a harmonious blend of traditions from two communities coexisting for centuries, united by a common language - Urdu. The legacy of the Nawabs of Awadh, who nurtured various art forms, including the exquisite Chikan work, has left an indelible mark on Lucknow\\'s cultural landscape. Chikan, a delicate form of hand embroidery, adorns a variety of fabrics with intricate designs, showcasing 36 distinct stitches. Renowned artisans like Ustad Faiyaaz Khan and Hasan Mirza Saheb have contributed to the prominence of Chikan work in Lucknow. Alongside Chikan, Lucknow is celebrated for its Zardozi and Kamdani embroidery, featuring gold and silver threads embellishing sarees, dupattas, and other garments. The city\\'s craftsmanship extends beyond textiles to encompass a plethora of other arts, including exquisite silverware, intricate ivory and bone carvings, fine pottery, and fragrant attars.

Today, as in the past, Chowk continues to embody the essence of Lucknowi culture, serving as a testament to the city\\'s timeless allure and enduring traditions.\\n\\nIn Uttar Pradesh, a rich tradition of art forms has flourished since ancient times, encompassing painting, sculpting, and intricate handcrafting. Painting, dating back to prehistoric eras, has evolved through various periods, including the illustrious Mughal Era, showcasing scenes from hunting, festivals, and the romantic life. Notably, the Mughal style of painting remains a pinnacle of Asian culture, distinguished by its unique presentation and style. The region of Bundelkhand witnessed the zenith of painting during the reconstruction of the temple of Keshav Dev in Mathura, portraying scenes from the life of Lord Krishna.

One of the most iconic crafts originating from Lucknow is chikankari, a delicate hand embroidery technique. Introduced in the 17th century, chikankari incorporates 36 different stitching techniques, resulting in exquisite designs on fabrics like chiffon, muslin, and silk. This art form, adorned with floral motifs, has become synonymous with Lucknow\\'s identity, with hundreds of retailers offering various chikankari products across the city. Another renowned craft is zardozi, which means gold embroidery in Persian. This luxurious embroidery technique, adorned with gold threads, pearls, beads, and sequins, was historically used to decorate tapestries, garments, and even royal elephants and horses. Lucknow\\'s perfume industry is equally famous, with perfumers creating delicate fragrances using aromatic herbs, spices, and floral essences. These fragrances, known as attars, have been in use since the 19th century and were even added to food during the era of the nawabs to enhance taste and aroma. The tradition of using natural substances to derive scents dates back to ascetics who burned plant material during meditative rituals, inspiring villagers to experiment with flower essences. These attars not only provided aromatic pleasure but also had therapeutic properties, creating a serene ambiance in the palaces of Lucknow. These crafts and industries, deeply rooted in Lucknow\\'s history and culture, continue to thrive, enriching the city\\'s cultural tapestry and attracting visitors from far and wide.\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Besides, the Bhikkhus who came to India, chiefly Bhikkhu Dhammapal, Bodhanand and Pragyanand, from Sri Lanka during the last and the first quarter of 20th and 21st century, respectively, contributed immensely to the revival of Buddhist history and culture in the northern part of the country. The Buddhists in Lucknow quickly name these Bhikkhus in the history of Buddha-Dhamma in Lucknow. Among Barau Buddhists, Bhikkhu Kripasaran is very much credited with spreading Buddha-Dhamma here. The role of Dr. Ambedkar is duly credited by both: Ambedkar-Buddhists as well as Barau-Buddhists.\\nGautam Buddha spent 24 monsoons, a major part of his life, in what is now Uttar Pradesh. People, generally, know that Buddha had spent some time of his life in Shravasti, Sarnath and Kushinagar etc., but the Buddhists in Lucknow strongly believe and argue that he might have visited many more places as well and modern Lucknow might be one among those. Modern Lucknow, according to  the hindu version, is said to be established by Lakshman, a mythical character in the epic, Ramayana. But there is another version of the origin of this name which says that Lucknow was earlier known as Nucklow (नखलऊ) (still used by aged people) and the history behind this is that the nails (नख) of Buddha were brought here and placed in a stupa. Thus placing of Buddha’s nails (नख) at this place gave it the name which later on changed from Nucklow (नखलऊ) to Lucknow (लखनऊ). Another story talks about Buddheshwar Chowraha where there once was a Buddhist shrine which was captured by hindus and later converted into a temple for Lord Shiva. There is one more folk legend among Buddhists in Lucknow about a Baudh Vihara called Amavasi Baudh Vihar where Buddhists used to gather on the day of the new moon (Amavasa). The contemporary airport named as ‘Amousi airport’ stands there now and the name Amousi came from that Vihara. Thus, there is a strong belief among Buddhists that the history of Lucknow boasts of a very rich Buddhist cultural heritage and hence invites sincere attention of archeologists and excavations.\\nAccording to 1951 census, the number of Buddhists in Lucknow district was 73, which reached 216, 322, 347, 2816, 4327 in 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001 censuses respectively. The 73 Buddhists in the 1951 census, before Dr. Ambedkar’s full-fledged campaign for Buddhism for ex-untouchables, were mainly the Bengali Barua Buddhist families who came here from Chittagong after the partition of Bengal in 1905. These Bengali Buddhists worked for the Britishers as their servants and cooks and also looked after their horses and stables. Now, the number of these Buddhists has reached 300-400 people.\\nThe biggest jump in the numbers of Buddhist population is observed in the census of 1991 and 2001. As per my observation, one of the most viable reasons seems to be the advent of the plethora of literature on Ambedkar, Asoka and Buddha written largely by government employees after 1990 and their active involvement in the dhamma activities. The census office in India for the first time in its history also revealed that almost 70% of the Buddhist population in Uttar Pradesh is from the scheduled castes background and 30% from others. It signifies that in ‘others’ there might be Buddhists from non-SCs. The case is further strengthened by some of my interviews and observations in Lucknow. Upon enquiry, many Buddhist activists and all the interviewees also accepted that backward castes are also getting inclined towards Buddhism. As a whole, Buddhists in Lucknow are mainly from diverse social backgrounds (Barau Bengalis, Scheduled Castes and Backward Castes\\nVisual 20th & 21st Century Architecture and their Related Figures\\n\\nThe foundation of twentieth century Buddhism in Lucknow was laid by the Bengali Barua Buddhists much before Dr. Ambedkar took deeksha. The Bodhisattva Vihar at Latus Road, Lucknow was built by Bhikkhu Kripasaran Mahasthavir (1865-1926), affiliated to the Bengal Buddhist Association, in 1907. By keeping intimate relationship with the then Education Secretary in the Government of India, Harcourt Butler (1869-1938), who was later on appointed as Governor of Agra and Oudh, Kripasaran could manage to acquire the land where the existing Vihara is situated.\\n\\nThe second oldest Buddha Vihar at Risaldar Park, Lucknow, affilited to Mahabodhi Society of India, was built by Bhikkhu Bodhanand, as he came back from Sri Lanka to revive Buddhism in India and became closely associated with Bhikkhu Kripasaran & Bodhisattva Vihar. His disciple, Bhikkhu Pragyanand (1928-), who is currently the head of the Vihara is one of the Bhikkhus (led by Bhikkhu Chandramani) who gave deeksha to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar in 1956. This Vihara is an important meeting place for Dalit, Bahujan and Buddhist activities. Dr. Ambedkar also stayed here twice, once in 1932 and later in 1948.\\n\\nA park called as Gautam Buddha Park which is situated near Rumi gate is also one of the significant developments as far as Buddhism in Lucknow is concerned. This park is built in around 10 acres by LDA in the year 1980 with a huge Buddha statue in sitting position. This is one of the biggest Buddha statues we come across in Lucknow. Many people assemble here on various occasions which are significant in Buddhist traditions and calendars.\\nIn the last decade of 20th century and first decade of 21st century, the Bahujan Samaj Party, on coming into power in UP, constructed roads, chowks, hostels, parks etc. in the name of Buddha. One of the most significant projects is the construction of Baudh Vihar Shanti Upvan on VIP road which is 1.2 km long and is spread in 32.5 acres consisting of a 18 feet tall four-sided marble statue of Gautam Buddha at the main entrance. On both sides of the statues there are two fountains (each 28 feet tall and 24 feet diameter). Almost 10-12 Bhikkhus reside in this Vihara and there is a dining hall which can accommodate approx. 60 people. This premises also includes a library and a meditation hall and dormitories for Bhikkhus and guest scholars.\\nAnother important place which attracts Buddhists in Lucknow is Parivartan Chowk (‘Change Square’) where a four-sided Buddha statue in sitting position is installed. This statue is placed under a tower made out of black granite and above this tower a white marble sphere is placed. This tower is surrounded by the statues of Dr. Ambedkar, Shahuji Maharaj, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule and Narayan guru at four corners. The place seems to be very important historically as it is surrounded by Lakshman park, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee park, Subhash park, Tagore park and Begam Hazarat Mahal park, etc. As this modern structure symbolizes ‘change’ various rallies, processions and demonstrations for social justice and Buddhist activities usually start from here.\\n\\nBesides the above Buddhist monuments, in the contemporary era, as the number of Buddhists are increasing, many Viharas at individual or community levels are also being constructed at various places in Lucknow such as Mahendra Baudh Vihara at LDA colony on Kanpur road, built by Mr. D. P. Varun (IAS Retd.), Mahamaya Buddh Vihara at Teli bagh by Kallu Baudh etc.\\n\\nTo conclude, my submission is that the Buddhism in Lucknow has deep historical and cultural connections which are found in a lot of local folklore. The socio-cultural composition of Buddhists in Lucknow consists of Bengali Barua Buddhists as well as SCs and OBCs. In modern times, many Bhikkhus, and Baudh Viharas, parks, chowks etc. are important catalysts in the spread of Buddhism.\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It usually takes place in the month of August or September. Devotees offer 56 different types of dishes to the deity as part of the rituals, and later these dishes are distributed among the devotees as Prasad (holy food).\\n\\nFood has always been a major part of all our celebrations, large and small. Of them, the Chappan Bhog has to be the heartiest, with as many as 56 dishes prepared for Lord Krishna, during Janmashtami and also for Govardhan puja post Diwali. Every year during this time, thousands of devotees throng Mathura, to offer 56 dishes to appease Krishna.\\n\\nI recall enjoying the feast at some of my neighbours\\' homes when I was a kid. Back then, my food appreciation was limited to meal hopping at my friends\\' houses and exploring the street food of Lucknow. It was only much later that I started exploring the concepts beyond. And that\\'s what led me to explore the story behind the Chappan Bhog.\\n\\nWhy does Chappan Bhog have 56 dishes?\\nLegend has it that Krishna held up the Govardhan mountain for a week to protect villagers and livestock from a torrential thunderstorm caused by the wrath of Lord Indra. As per the legend, Krishna held up the mountain for seven days straight, skipping his usual eight meals a day. Once the rains abated, the villagers offered their thanks by preparing the Annakuta or mountain of food. This was a combination of the eight meals of the day multiplied times seven and hence, fifty-six.\\n\\nIn the book The Eternal Food: Gastronomic ideas and Experiences of Hindus and Buddhists, author Paul M Toomey talks about food “both as the main commodity of the pilgrimage culture and as a communicator of social and religious messages”. I couldn\\'t agree more with the philosophy.\\n\\nWhat goes into a Chappan Bhog?\\nThe typical offerings included in the Chappan Bhog comprise a variety of cereals, fruits and dry fruits, vegetable preparations, sweets, beverages, savouries and chutneys and pickles. However, the actual dishes of the Chapan Bhog vary across regions based on their culinary practices, spiritual connotations and ingredients available. Apart from the customary favourites of butter, yogurt, ghee and rice, there are others that range from sweet: mohan bhog (a semolina halwa), shakkarpara, ghewar, rabri and shrikhand to savoury: khichdi, puri, saag (cooked greens), as well as nuts, papad and chutneys. Of these, the dairy and sweet preparations are placed closest to the deity as they are believed to be dearer to Lord Krishna\\'s palate.\\n\\nBut beyond the concept and legend behind the ritual, there is a larger philosophy at work. One that intrigues me more.\\n\\nOur five fingers have five rasas: sweet, salty, sour, spicy and savoury. When we cook with our hands, these five rasas get transferred to the food. Looking at the larger picture of the Chappan Bhog, I\\'d like to think that this grand feast is a bigger manifestation of those rasas. After all, what better medium to convey and transfer feelings than food? In artistic or literary terms, rasa can be called the aesthetic flavour of any form of art that elicits the desired emotion in the mind of the reader or viewer. Likewise, food is a source of emotion too, it brings joy, it brings back memories, it opens up conversations. When food is prepared for and offered to the gods, it is believed to become even more sacred, having been ‘consumed\\' by the powers above. So, the 56 dishes being ‘accepted\\' by Krishna and then distributed among his devotees is symbolic of the rasas or relationship with him being established.\\n\\nThe contribution of temples towards nurturing local cuisine and preserving our food culture deserves a special mention here. For decades, temples in India have been using the same recipes and cooking techniques, which if not maintained by them, would\\'ve been lost a long time ago. For example, at Jagannath Temple in Puri—believed to have the largest kitchen in the world—the Mahaprasad is still cooked in earthen pots placed in a pyramid over wood fire. Here it is a daily ritual to offer no less than 56 dishes to the deity. The earthen pots retain both flavour and heat uniformly, making the food last for longer periods of time. The menu at the temple is unique in its own way:  there\\'s the simple ukhuda (sugar-coated puffed rice), arisha (fried sweet cake made with rice flour), varieties of bhaja or fritters, a chilli laddoo called maric ladu, dalma (vegetables cooked with lentils), amalu (malpua) and many more.\\n\\nAt the Shri Swaminarayan temple in London, every year the Annakut is a grand display that stretches over seven tiers with more than a thousand dishes, stretching over 85 feet!\\n\\nSo this Krishna Janmashtami, let\\'s seek an emotional completion through these 56 mediums, and celebrate the rasas of our oneness with God with the rasas in food.\\n\\nA Lucknow-based sweetmeat shop has prepared the 56 ‘bhog’ thaali to be offered to the deity, says Acharya Satyendra Das, chief priest of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi\\nLUCKNOW A unique platter of 56 sweet delicacies - ‘Chhappan Bhog’ - has been sent from Lucknow to Ayodhya that will be offered to the deity as a first bhog immediately after the Pran Pratishtha ceremony of Ram Lalla on January 22 .\\n\\nSrajal Gupta of Madhurima Sweets, Lucknow, who curated this unique thaali, said: “We made special ‘Tulsi bhog’ made of tulsi leaves, swarn kalash (sweets with unique gold coating), pistachio barfi, Mysore-pak, mewa bundi laddoo, cashewnut barfi, badam barfi, Kesar barfi, silver coated badam and ilaichi, makhana-pak, mewa panjiri, kaju roast katley, makkhan peda, kesaria misri, milk cake, kesariya gujiya, moti-pak, sohan halwa and many other delicacies.”\\n\\nGupta said he made this offering after speaking to Ram Temple’s chief priest Acharya Satyendra Das. “We handed over the special thaali to him.

There are many fascinating facts about it that make it a popular tourist attraction in Lucknow. One of them is that it is it was the first English church to be built in North India and the third in India. In fact, there was not a single church built between the years 1700 and 1819. Today, it intrigues onlookers and visitors with its elegant architecture, but also by the historical aura that pervades it. It is situated in the Hazratganj area. Although the church is not enormous in size, there is an old world feel to it that makes it special. However, you would not sense that until you actually enter its interiors and spend some time there. Visiting this church during your trip to Lucknow promises to be an informative and enlightening experience.\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nBefore you read a short history of Christ Church, you should also know something about the other churches in the country. The first church built in India by the Britishers was at Madras in the year 1680. It was known as St. Mary\\'s Church. This was followed by another church built in Kolkata in 1770 and known as St. John\\'s Church. It was only in 1810 that a church was built in Lucknow, thus becoming the third city in India with a church. At that time however, this church was known as St. Mary\\'s Church and it was built in the area known as British Residency.\\r\\nLike many other parts of the country, the church did not go unscated during the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, also known as the First Struggle for India\\'s Independence. It came under repeated attacks by the sepoys, with the worst attack carried out on 31st July and 5th August, 1857. It should be remembered however, that the attack was not motivated by any religious causes. It was attacked because the British used the church as a storage house for ammunition and weapons. Call it a stroke of luck or what you will, the church escaped being blown to smithereens by the British. During the next three years, while the church remained in a damaged state, the tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan and later the Sibtainabad Imambara served as places for Christian worship. Regular masses were also held at these religious places.\\r\\nIt is also interesting to know that for a short period of time, the gardens of the church were converted into a cemetery. The first people to be buried there were those that fell victims to the surprise attacks carried out by the Indian sepoys on 30th May, 1857.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nChrist Church is built in the Gothic style of architecture, just like most of the other churches across India. It is topped with twenty steeples, with a cross situated at the top of the entrance on the north. The church has an accommodation capacity of 130 persons at any given time. Observe its interiors though, and you will come across numerous marble tablets and polished brass plaques installed to honor the memory of British army officials, civilians and clergy who lost their lives in the conflict. These tablets are both a moving and impressive sight. One of the tablets is dedicated to James Grant Thomson, Deputy Commissioner of Muhamadee who lost his life fighting off the sepoys in Oudh on 5th June, 1857. Another of such tablets is dedicated to Revered Henry Polehampton. The church underwent extensive renovations and architectural modifications in 1904. The bell tower, which consists of a spire pointing towards the sky with a cross at the top, is a major eye turner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPopular Tourist Attractions Nearby\\r\\nBesides Christ Church, which is a major tourist attraction in Lucknow, there are other places that offer wonderful opportunities for sightseeing and exploration. Here are some of the other tourist places in Lucknow which you should definitely check out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSikandar Bagh\\r\\nThe Residency\\r\\nSt. Agnes Church\\r\\nRumi Darwaza\\r\\nAmbedkar Memorial Park\\r\\nNawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden\\r\\nJaneshwar Mishra Park\\r\\nNational Botanical Research Institute\\r\\nBara Imambara\\r\\nChota Imambara\\r\\n\\r\\nBest Time to Visit\\r\\nObviously, as a religious structure and holy place of worship, the Christ Church can be visited and is open throughout the year (subject the church timings of course). As far as the best time to visit the church goes, it depends on the kind of weather you are comfortable travelling in. During the summers, just like the rest of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow can get quite hot. The average temperature during this time is 42°C and can be a daunting factor for many people. If the heat and humidity doesn’t bother you much, go ahead and plan a trip during this time. It is during the winters though, that Lucknow receives cool and pleasant weather. Most tourists find the weather during this time to be quite agreeable and plan a trip during this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-Lalbagh Methodist Church Lucknow\\r\\n\\r\\nLalbagh Methodist Church Lucknow\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lal Bagh Methodical Church in Lucknow, built in the Gothic style of architecture, with its pointed vault and ribbed faults, is a picture of elegance with simplicity. It was William Butler who began English services in Lucknow, with the congregation being formed in 1870. Until 1972, except for a brief period from 1942-1944, all the pastors of the church were foreigners. It was only in 1974 that Indians were appointed as pastors of the church. Today, there were over 300 members in the church, including children.\\r\\nWhile there are other famous religious places to visit in Lucknow, you should visit this church for its historical significance and architecture, which combines grace with style. The altar faces the west direction while the main entrance door faces the eastern direction. The entrance has three doors, all of which are covered with a sloping portico. The northern part of the tower which faces out front is marked by a three storied tower.\\r\\nThe top portion of the tower is pointed and is mounted by a criss cross of steel. The middle portion of the roof is mounted by small crosses which present a lovely sight. Inside, facing the altar is a steel cross which is suspended in close proximity to the pulpit through a wire.\\r\\nBest Time to Visit Lal Bagh Methodical Church\\r\\nLabagh Methodist Church, as a religious structure, can be visited throughout the year. When it comes to the best time to visit it however, that\\'s a different issue altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n If you are comfortable travelling during summers, then by all means, visit it during this time. Remember though, that the average temperature during this time is around 42°C. A lot of tourists can find the temperature quite daunting. During the winters, the weather becomes cool and pleasant and creates the perfect conditions for sightseeing and exploration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-All Saints Garrison Church Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\nAll Saints Garrison Church Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the famous churches in India, or anywhere else in the world for that matter, have you ever heard of one which allowed people to carry weapons inside? All Saints Garrison Church, located in the Cantonment area of Lucknow, is one of them.\\r\\nBefore you jump to any conclusions, you should know how and why such a development came to take place, and the circumstances which led to it. As you enter the church, a sign greets you at the main door which reads, Whosoever thou art that enterest this church, leave it not without one Prayer to God for thyself, for those who minister, and for those who worship here.\\r\\nIt is a large impressive building to come across, one that is visible from quite a distance. At one point in time, it served as a church for those British residents who settled in the Cantonment area after escaping the British Residency when it was attacked by Indian sepoys. Even though it wears a forlorn look today, it does not fail to impress with its size and aesthetical elements. Stare at it from a distance for quite some time though, and you will feel a loneliness in the atmosphere, as if the church was yearning for the days gone by. Among the many churches to visit in Lucknow, this is one which you should not miss.\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nThough the All Saints Garrison Church impresses visitors with its size today, it wasn\\'t always so. It was first built in 1860, and was considerably smaller in terms of its size and proportions then. As time passed, however, the Lucknow Cantonment (the new settlement of the British after they had escaped the Residency) grew in size, as did the number of troops. Naturally, the need for a larger church was felt.\\r\\nAfter the construction of the new church was completed, it was named All Saints New Garrison Church. In fact, if you head towards the north west corner of the church about 15 to 20 feet away, you will come across a stone. The stone stands at the very same spot where the altar of the church was constructed in 1860.\\r\\nThe new church was built in 1908 by Jones Ransom, a British engineer who is also credited with having created the design for Saint Mungo\\'s Church of Scotland in the Cantonment area of Lucknow. Although he had made considerable progress with the construction of the church, he had to leave it midway and return to England. The work was then completed by Lishman who was supervised by the notable architect John Baggs.\\r\\nThe most interesting part of its history though, is the decision to allow guns inside its premises. It is commonly believed that during the Revolt of 1857, the Indian sepoys had entered the premises to attack the British and as a result, many had lost their lives. To avoid that tragedy, people were permitted to carry weapons inside during prayers.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nIn terms of architecture, the All Saints Garrison Church stands second to none. It is imposing, particularly its facade which is marked by an enormous tower. Even though the church was originally built by Jones Ransom, it underwent subsequent modifications under engineers who succeeded him. An example of this is the tower, which, in its original form, was meant to be taller than its present height. Another example is the side walls which were greatly reduced in both thickness and height, so as to save the overall expenses.\\r\\nHowever, even though its construction was largely influenced by considerations of money and expenses, it still manages to retain its elegance. When it comes to the seating capacity though, this church has a larger seating capacity than any other church in Lucknow. Its large space is also visible in the quadrangle, which has seating areas made of ply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the seating arrangements though, which strike the attention of the visitors and stand out as far as the architecture of the church is concerned. All the benches consist of a niche which was once used for keeping guns on the upper back side. This was done to enable the soldiers returning from their duties to participate in the prayers and other rituals while being in possession of their weapons.\\r\\nPopular Tourist Attractions Nearby\\r\\nLucknow is dotted with plenty of tourist places which offer great opportunities for sightseeing and exploration. After visiting All Saints Garrison Church, here are some of the other places which you can check out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Agnes Church\\r\\nChrist Church\\r\\nThe Residency\\r\\nSt. Agnes Church\\r\\nRumi Darwaza\\r\\nAmbedkar Memorial Park\\r\\nSikandar Bagh\\r\\nNawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden\\r\\nJaneshwar Mishra Park\\r\\nAssembly of God\\'s Church\\r\\nSt. Paul\\'s Church\\r\\nNational Botanical Research Institute\\r\\nBara Imambara\\r\\nChota Imambara\\r\\n\\r\\nBest Time to Visit\\r\\nAll Saints Garrison Church is a place of worship and can be visited throughout the year, subject to the timings of the church.

One was the Cantonment Church (also known as St. Paul\\'s Church) and the other was the Chapel in the Civil Lines (also known as St. Joseph\\'s). These two churches also were still under construction when they were blessed by the Bishop. In the book, he also mentions that the Assembly of God\\'s Church was built by the government and was a part of Diocese of Lucknow and follows Roman Rite.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nThe first sight that catches your eyes upon arriving at Assembly of God\\'s Church in Lucknow is the grotto. It was erected on 1st January 1946 by the parishioners of St. Paul\\'s and external benefactors. The entrance door is marked by two confessionals on either sides. There is a beautiful ceiling along with wooden pews which are a feature common to every church.\\r\\nBest Time to Visit\\r\\nThe Assembly of God\\'s Church is located in Lucknow.

Regarded as one of the finest cities of India, Lucknow emanates a culture that combines emotional warmth, a high degree of sophistication, courtesy, and a love for gracious living. This sublime cultural richness famous as 'Lucknowi Tehzeeb' blends the cultures of two communities living side by side for centuries, sharing similar interests, speaking a common language -Urdu. Many of the cultural traits and customs peculiar to Lucknow have become living legends today. The credit for this goes to the Nawabs of Awadh, who took keen interest in every walk of life and encouraged them to attain a rare degree of perfection.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nCRAFT\\r\\nFor centuries Lucknow has been famous for its various handicraft works. The Nawabs of Awadh were great patrons of fine arts of which the most well-known is the exquisite Chikan work. Chikan is a unique craft involving delicate and artistic hand embroidery in a variety of textile fabric like muslin, siIk, chiffon, organza, doriya and argandi. There are 36 types of stitches used in chikan work. of which murri, bakhia, jali, tepchi, tappa, dhum, katao are widely used to produce exquisite designs. Lucknow has produced many renowned artisans of chikan work like Ustad Faiyaaz Khan and Hasan Mirza Saheb.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from kurtas. sarees. salwar suits, topis, hankeys and dupattas, chikan embroidery is being used on new items like table covers, tray covers, napkins etc. The demand for these exquisite art pieces is ever increasing both in India and abroad. In Lucknow, the main concentration of chikan work is to be found in the chowk locality and Daliganj. Besides chikan work the Zardozi and Kamdani works of Lucknow are also appreciated far and wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese hand embroidery works with gold and silver thread are done on sarees, dupattas, lehengas, cholis, caps, shoes etc. From time immemorial Lucknow is known for its jewellery and enamelling work.\\r\\n\\r\\nExquisite silverwares like bowls, tea-sets, salt cellars with patterns of hunting scenes, snakes and roses are immensely popular. The Bidri and Zarbuland silver works of Lucknow find expression on excellent pieces of huqqa farshi, jewel boxes, trays, bowls, cufflinks, cigarette holders, etc. Life -like ivory and bone carvings from Lucknow with motifs of flowers, leaves, creepers, trees, birds, and animals are widely appreciated. The master craftsmen create intricate items like knives, lamp shades, shirt pins and small toys. In fact, the ivory works from this city continue to find a place at museums and private collections of connoisseurs Fine pottery from Lucknow is yet another work of art that has captured the imagination of the consumers. The long-necked water pitchers and huqqa farshi are especially popular. 'Attar'('Itr') or perfumes which were introduced in India by the Muslims, reached a new hight in Lucknow. From the 19th century the Lucknow perfumers experimented and succeeded in making attar with delicate and lasting fragrances Created from various aromatic herbs, spices, sandal oil, musk essence of flowers, and leaves the famous Lucknowi fragrances are khus, keora, chameli, zafran and agar Apart from perfumes, Lucknowi Paan, Zarda (chewing tobacco), and Khamira produced by the local tobacconists are hot favourites among consumers. Another craft that has reached a high level of artistry in Lucknow is Kite making. Although Kite making is popular throughout India, this activity has attained perfection only in Lucknow. Under Nawabi patronage this form of art flourished in Lucknow and different types of Kites and flying strings were developed. Besides these well-known craft works, mention must be made to some other flourishing crafts like gota weaving, dyeing and calico printing, silver varq making, woodworks and tazia making. Beautiful tazias of zari, gold and silver paper are made by master craftsmen to mark the solemn occasion of Moharrum. All in all, with these multifarious craft specialities Lucknow promises to be a shoppers' delight that is hard to resist. In their own distinctive wav these crafts have provided employment to thousands, delighted many more and continues to keep alive the invaluable traditions of a magnificent city\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nCULTURE\\r\\n'Lucknow', this name is synonymous with architectural beauties of 'Lakhauri' bricks, the fragrance of 'itra', musical notes, the sound of dancers' trinklets, the sweetness of 'dussheri' mangoes, 'malai' and 'gulab revadis', and of course it's 'Mehman Nawazi'. Known for its refinement in speech, entertainment, dresses and manners, Lucknow is also called the 'City of Adab'. In fact, it is here that one can experience hospitality in the true sense of the term. Various cultural ingredients have contributed to the richness of this unique city. Mention must be made of the Urdu language. Gazals, Shairi, expressive dance forms, colourful festivals, buzzing chowks and various exciting games like Patangbazi, Baterbazi & Kabutarbazi.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucknow became the focal point of a cultural renaissance with the shifting of capital from Faizabad to Lucknow in 1776. Under royal patronage Kathak, Thumri, Khayal, Dadra, Gazals, Qawalies and Sher-o-Shairi reached their zenith point. As a centre of Islamic learning Lucknow witnessed the formation of Lucknow school of poetry under renowned poets like Anes, Dabeer, Imam-Buksh 'Nasika', Mirza Mohd. Raza Khan Burq, Atish, Mirza Shauq Asar, Josh and others. Apart from Gazals, another form of long narrative poem for which Lucknow is famous is Masnavi. Elegy writing in Urdu also reached a new height through the three forms-'marsiyas'. 'salams' and 'nauhas'. Urdu as a language attained a rare degree of perfection in Lucknow and slowly Lucknow emerged as a cradle of unforgettable gazals, masnavi, elegy, hazal and dramas.\\r\\n\\r\\nNawab Wajid Ali Shah, himself composed a number of songs and dramas under the pen name of, 'Akhtari Pia'. Of the famous Indian dance styles kathak is strongly associated with Lucknow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis devotional dance style of pre-Mughal days was transformed into a highly eclectic dance form under the patronage of the Nawabs of Awadh. Pandit Iswari Prasad Mishra of Handia is said to be the founder of the Lucknow gharana of Kathak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kathak school founded by him was perfected by his sons Thakur Prasad, Durga Parsad.

'Chowk' has played a vital role in the development of the Lucknowi culture. It is the pivotal point around which the traders, engravers, painters. artisans, weavers, singers, and nautch girls flourished and grew.

Lucknow traditional music is highly evolved and every detail is taken into attention while singing so as to impart the right feel and the meaning.\\nThe famous Lucknow Gharana was created in the royal courts of the Nawabs of Lucknow.

The festival showcases the sweetness and uniqueness of the Lucknowi zubaan (language) and highlights the art and craft of the region. Visitors can also enjoy a wide range of food options from popular food joints. The festival will culminate with the Awadhi Home Cooked Food Festival. \\n\\nThe ongoing Mahindra Sanatkada Festival has come up with a blend of cultural events during the five-day event that is underway at Safed Baradari, Kaiserbagh. From dastaangoi, music, dance to theatre there is a lot being offered to the visitors besides the literary sessions, shopping and food. We bring out the action from the opening day. Dastango Mehmood Abdi, a lawyer by profession, says that sweetness in Lucknowi zubaan is a beautiful amalgamation of Hindi and Urdu and Awadhi dialect. “Jo sweetness hai Lucknow ki zubaan mein wo Awadhi se ayi hai. The strength of our language is such that even in a crowd Lucknowites could be singled out when they speak,” says Abdi. He also talked about taqsali zubaan (as a coin minting unit was established in Chowk area) which diluted purity of language like nihari became nahari, taqt became thakat and so on. Lucknowite Askari Naqvi presented three ghazals of Meer Taqi Meer. He was well-supported by Naveen Mishra, Mohd Rafi, Tushar Sahai, Harshwardhan Singh Negi, Aditya Pratap Singh, Aaditya and Abhieraj Shahi. \\n\\n“Tried adding a new dimension to my strength of performance such as dastaangoi and sozkhwani. This is the first time I have performed with a band which plays mix of classical instruments like sitar, tabla and shehnai along with modern devices,” shares Askari. The play Taking Threads,held at the Baradari by Swatantra Talim, team turned out to be a well-curated act where live display of threads, weaving, sharp script, strong narration and smart acts were elegantly weaved together to showcase the life of artisans. The play was inspired by real-life stories of women artisans of chikan-kaarigari . \\n\\n“We have curated events that highlight art and craft in literal sense. Such meaningful presentations create awareness about our indigenous crafts,” says Sanatkada founder Madhvi Kuckreja. Besides, Neelakshi Rai captivated the audience with her kathak performance on songs like Chupke Chupke Raat Din and Hamari Atariya Pe. The attraction for visitors at the fest is not just the shopping and cultural arena. Options are available at the Baradari open area and at the Salempur House lawns. “We tried light options like chaat, piping hot pakori besides the home-cooked snacks at Naimatkhan stall. But the real action is at the lawns where kebabs and kulcha-nihari stalls are set up. The perfect ending was with Kashmiri chai with malai,” adds a visitor, Umesh Gupta. Popular food joints like Raheem’s, Tundey Kababi, Tiwari Chaat and Ah So Yum have been placed at the venue. From dimsums, bao, sushi, Rajasthani food, home-cooked khichda and Awadhi food, options are aplenty.The highlight of the Sunday afternoon will be the most awaited Awadhi Home Cooked Food Festival, that sees a big turnout of foodies.\\n\\nA puzzle, a riddle, an emotion, a passion, a way of life for some, a waste of time for others.

Sri Venkateshwar Temple\\nYou will be stopped short in your tracks if you suddenly come across this temple and might suddenly think that you are in some city in South India! The temple is actually dedicated to Lord Balaji, the manifestation of Vishnu which is mostly worshipped in the southern states of India. The temple, as well as the shrine, is built in traditional Dravidian architecture and design and there is also a magnificent 50 feet high pyramidal entrance, which is seen in almost the temple of South India. Some simply come here to witness the elaborately carved gopuram if they cannot go inside. The huge temple complex is about 27,000 in area and apart from Lord Venkateshwar, there are also shrines which are dedicated to Lord Hanuman, Goddess Padmavati and the Navagraha or the nine planets. Naturally, the temple records a high footfall every day. The temple is open from 6 am to 8 pm in summers and 7 am to 7 pm in winters.\\n\\n2. Chandrika Devi Temple \\nThis stunning temple is located in the banks of the Gomti River at Khantwara and this is a very quiet place in the outskirts of the busy city of Lucknow.

He had built the temple in honor of Goddess Chandrika, who was a manifestation of Goddess Parvati. You will first set your eyes on a beautiful idol of Lord Shiva seated in the middle of a water pool. The maximum footfall in the temple is recorded during new moon nights, when offerings are made to the Goddess, and during the nine nights of Navaratri. A fair is organized at that time and devotees come from far and wide. The temple remains open from 5 am to 1 pm and then from 2 pm to 11 pm.\\n\\n3. Hanuman Temple\\naliganj hanuman temple in lucknow\\nThe Hanuman Temple is located in Aliganj in Lucknow and he happens to be a most revered deity here.

The big festival here is the Bada- Mangal, or the Big Tuesday, and it happens around four or five times during the months of May and June.

According to legends, the temple was actually built by Kush, the son of Lord Rama, for a Nag Kanya or serpent woman whom he fell in love with and had it built for her because she was a devotee of Lord Shiva. Then the old town fell to ruins and the forests engulfed the surrounding landscape till it was discovered 300 years ago. The lore around the temple definitely makes it a place of must-visit.

With its multicultural heritage, Lucknow flourished as a hub of North Indian culture and arts, particularly during the reign of the Nawabs in the 18th and 19th centuries. The city's history dates back to ancient times, with legends tracing its origin to Ramchandra of Ayodhya, who supposedly gifted the territory to his brother Lakshmana. Lucknow gained prominence under the Nawabs of Awadh, who made it their capital, fostering a vibrant cultural scene and commissioning architectural marvels such as the Bada Imambara, Chota Imambara, and Rumi Darwaza. The city's strategic location at the junction of various roads and rail lines, coupled with its historical significance, makes it a prominent center in northern India. Today, Lucknow continues to thrive as a dynamic city, blending its rich heritage with modern developments, including educational institutions like City Montessori School, notable architectural landmarks like Charbagh Railway Station and Husainabad Clock Tower, and a diverse culinary scene renowned for its delectable cuisine such as chikankari work and traditional dishes like laknavi biryani and pasanda kebabs.\\n\\n\\nLucknow, situated on the banks of the Gomti River in northern India, is a city that seamlessly blends Mughal heritage with elements of Turkish, Persian, and European cultures. Known as the capital and largest city of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow is affectionately referred to as the city of Nawabs, owing to the extravagant lifestyles of its rulers during the 18th and 19th centuries under the Mughal Empire. This rich cultural tapestry has earned Lucknow the title of the center of north Indian culture and heritage. Historically, Lucknow played a pivotal role during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, serving as the starting point for the uprising against British forces. Notably, it was the site of the first meeting between Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Mohd Ali Jinnah in 1916, signifying a significant moment in India's fight for independence. Architecturally, Lucknow boasts several iconic landmarks, including the historic Rumi Darwaza and the imposing Bara Imambara, a marvel of unsupported construction. The city is also renowned for its unique chikankari embroidery, tracing its origins back to ancient times and reflecting a blend of Persian and Mughal influences.

Tracing its origins back to the Suryavanshi Dynasty, Lucknow's founding myth is tied to Lakshmana, who built the city on elevated land near the Gomati River, naming it Lakshmanpur. The city's cultural and historic evolution owes much to the Mughal Empire, particularly during the Nawab dynasty in the 18th century. Notably, Lucknow flourished in various fields during the reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, marking a golden period for the city. The Rebellion of 1857, India's first war of freedom, saw Lucknow as a hotspot of rebellious activities against British rule, igniting the flames of uprising across the region. Lucknow's cultural richness is evident in its architectural marvels, influenced by Mughal, Turkish, and European styles, including iconic landmarks like Bara Imambara and La Martiniere College. The city's cuisine, particularly Awadhi cuisine, is celebrated for its diverse flavors, including biryani, kebabs, and bread.

Additionally, Lucknow has been a hub for classical Indian dance forms like Kathak, and has produced renowned musicians and poets. The city is also famed for its embroidery work, particularly Chikankari, a 400-year-old art form unique to Lucknow.

Bara Imambara, meaning 'big hall', constructed by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, is a magnificent architectural marvel featuring a labyrinth, bowli, and running watered stepwell, boasting of 1024 ways to reach the terrace but only one to return. The unique festival dedicated to Lord Hanuman, celebrated solely in Lucknow on the first and last Tuesdays of the Jyestha month, draws approximately eight lakh devotees each week. Rumi Darwaza, also known as the Turkish gate, built by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, not only showcases exquisite architecture but also symbolizes the Nawab's compassion during famine, as it was erected to provide employment to the locals. Janeshwar Mishra Park, Asia's tenth-largest park, built in tribute to the late politician, offers serene surroundings and draws inspiration from London's Hyde Park. Lucknow Racecourse, established in 1880 during the colonial era, remains a cherished venue for elite horse racing enthusiasts, covering 70 acres in the Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg area. Kukrail Garden, an oasis on the city's outskirts, serves as a breeding center for endangered crocodile species while doubling as a picturesque picnic spot. Husainabad Clocktower, standing tall at 221 feet, adjacent to Rumi Darwaza, captivates with its Victorian and Gothic architectural charm and houses a massive 14-foot pendulum.

He held this position from the time he left India in 1964.\\n\\nEarly life: Herbert Günther was born in Bremen, Germany, as the only son of Reinhold Günther and his wife. Because he showed a great interest in the Orient from an early age, his father encouraged him to pursue studies in this field. To this end, he began the study of the Chinese language when he was nine. By the time he graduated from high school in 1936, he had also learned the Sanskrit language.\\n\\nEducation and early academia: Günther went to Munich for further study after graduation, earning the Ph.D. degree in 1939. Four years later he received the degree Dr. Phil. Habil. in Vienna. From this beginning, Günther went on to become one of the leading Buddhist scholars of our time. Amongst the most influential of his European mentors were Professor Wilhelm Geiger, a specialist in Pali and Sinhalese, and Walter Wüst – both of Munich. In Vienna, W. Havers was his main teacher. During this time his aptitude for languages manifested itself.

The original “Tunday Kababi” shop in the old Chowk area is where aficionados throng to get a taste of this legendary dish. It’s not just food; it’s a piece of history served on a plate.

The carnival, which is organized once a month during summer season and twice a month during winter season at Mahatma Gandhi Marg in Hazratganj, encapsulates all the distinctive features of Hazratganj of the bygone era. Artists can demonstrate their talent from a large stage, which is set up in front of multi-level parking. The stage is also used for various musical, dance and cultural performances by popular celebrity-artists. Visitors can watch movies based on Lucknow’s history and culture at Soochna Kendra Library office in Hazratganj. Nukkad natak, art gallery, selfie zone, kid zone, photo exhibition, to name a few, are some of the highlights of the carnival. Food enthusiasts can relish their taste buds at the food stalls, starting from Raheem’s, Tunday Kebabi, Wahid Biryani, Naushi-jaan, Moti Mahal and Prakash Kulfi.\\n\\nThe Ganjing Carnival is a five-hour event in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh that celebrates the heritage of Hazratganj, a shopping area in the city. The carnival includes music and dance performances, food courts, an art gallery, photo exhibitions, and selfie zones. The district administration has decided to organize the carnival once a month, with each month having a different theme. \\n\\nThe carnival features standard features such as a food court, art gallery, handicraft, talent hunt, and photo exhibition. The carnival also includes selfie zones with large cutouts of Lucknow\\'s heritage buildings. \\n\\nThe carnival celebrates Hazratganj\\'s 200-year history. Hazratganj is one of Lucknow\\'s oldest and most iconic areas, with a rich history dating back to the time of the Nawabs of Awadh. The area was originally known as Ganj-e-Sabun, which means \"soap market,\" as it was a hub for soap makers during the 18th century. Hazratganj is now a major Victorian-style shopping area that houses showrooms, shopping complexes, restaurants, hotels, cafés, theaters, offices, and businesses. \\n\\nA stroll or window shopping at Lucknow’s oldest and prestigious shopping destination, Hazrat Ganj, is often known as Ganj-ing. Hazratganj, the 200+ year old elite shopping and entertainment zone, has seen quite a happening past. In 1810, the first nawab of Awadh, Saadat Ali Khan, brought up the idea of such a place. After him, it was Nawab Nasiruddin Haider who nurtured this dream and commissioned many buildings and Kothis in Hazrat Ganj. Earlier called Munnawar Baksh probably because of Munnawar Kothi built there, the area was renamed to Hazrat Ganj in 1842, drawing from the nickname of Nawab Amjad Ali Shah who was often lovingly called “Hazrat”.\\n\\nThere was a time when Hazrat Ganj had a distinctive charm with a fine blend of mughal architecture and a victorian feel in the buildings, sidewalks, and even the vehicles and horse-carriages used by the nawabs and the British officers. Pedestrians too used to enjoy the walk across the shops, movie theatres, ball room, clock tower, and the coffee house. Today, if we need to relive that era, Hazratganj, the heritage area of Lucknow, needs to be transformed for a while. District Administration of Lucknow did just that when they planned the Ganjing Carnival at Hazratganj Lucknow.\\n\\nOn Sunday May 24, 2015, Hazratganj was made out of bounds for any kind of vehicles from the main crossroad near GPO till the office of the Chief Post Master General. The duration of the Ganjing Carnival was five hours, starting from 5:00 PM till 10:00 PM. District administration put up a great show by setting up stages for Music and Dance performances, Food courts, Art gallery, photo exhibitions, selfie zones with huge cutouts of Lucknow’s heritage buildings and lots more.\\n\\nThe excitement among the crowds was worth taking a note. Lucknowites were flocking in with family members and friends, posing for Picture of lucknow policemen patrolling on horseback at the Ganjing Carnivalpictures, enjoying the food and music, amidst the confidence that they were safe and free to roam about the long stretch of the main street – M.G.Road. Every sidelane that opened    into the main street had police personnel deployed. There were scores of civil defence personnel. A wonderful view was to see the Policemen riding horses for patrolling. What might have helped to ensure safety and  checking any untoward incident was the installation of CCTV cameras on the lamp-posts. It helped in keeping a tab on the small bunch of mischief-makers and spoilsports.\\n\\nThe event was such a huge success among the citizen of Lucknow that the district administration has decided to hold the event once a month during summers and twice a month during rainy season and winters.\\n\\n\\nAny historical city in the world stands out because of its heritage, culture, cuisine, languages, dialects, people and the typical style of living. Lucknow city, a unique concoction of all such factors is also a representative of the British influence that makes Lucknow a well-known city on the map of Indian tourism. Every city bears a disparate blend of charm and essence, an air about their ambiences, which are its earmark and make them unique in its own way. The parks, markets, monuments, public buildings, which are the essential part of the identity of any city.\\n\\nHazratganj is not only a market, but also a representative of the city’s rich heritage and culture, which still continues to attract the generation as it used to era’s back. The true essence of the Nawabi era can be relished completely by spending an evening at this place. This ravishments evening can be termed as ‘Ganjing’ and one can truly comprehend with it if he/she is a true Lucknowite at heart.\\n\\nThe 200+ year-old elite shopping and entertainment zone has seen quite a happening past. It was in 1810 that nawab of Oudh, Saadat Ali Khan came up with such a place in his mind and this dream of his was nurtured by Nawab Naseer-ud-Din Haider who is accredited with construction of numerous Kothis and buildings in that area. The area known by the name Munawwar Baksh, probably because of Munawwar Kothi of that are was later on renamed to Hazrat Ganj years later in 1842, rendering its name from the fourth king of Oudh, Amjad Ali Shah who was often lovingly called ‘Hazarat’\\n\\nAs the marketplace witnessed 100 years of its completion, it saw a massive changeover in European style designed buildings. In order to bring uniformity the complete area was repainted into the same colour-coordinated theme of cream and pink, benches were fixed at every few metres along with elegant European style lampposts and fountains and railings that replicate the Victorian age broad walk. The motive behind this beautification was to uplift and restore the dying popularity of the place. The idea was to restore the place back in its ancient and traditional look along with a touch of modernity.\\n\\nThe District Administration of Lucknow just decided to give back Lucknow its old charm of the perfect blend of the Mughal era and the Victorian feel when they planned the Ganjing Carnival, encapsulating almost all the lineaments of the Hazratganj of the bygone era.\\n\\nIt was on Sunday, May 24, 2015, that Hazratganj witnesses a massive change, the roads were made out of bound for all kind of vehicles, from the main crossroad near GPO till the office of the Chief Post Master General. The announcement of Hazratganj being a no vehicle zone on Sundays along the stretch has already brought back excitement around the boulevard, particularly to those who prefer Hazratganj over swanky shopping malls.\\n\\nThe preparation began from the early morning itself and what lead to the place by the evening left everyone awe struck. The excitement among the crowds was worth taking a note. It was an initiative that was taken to bring the city together for not only reviving the good old days but to inculcate togetherness, joy, laughter, song and what not to count, among the clan and the kin, but coming together of 30,000 souls on a hot summer evening in the heart of the city was surely one unexpected thing to witness. The scorching heat was of no good to keep the enthusiasm of the Youngers to a restricted zone or timing. The city saw the best of fashion and spirit combined in this one evening. The cherry on the cake was a remarkable management of the show with no report of crime or any kind of uneventful circumstances. Every side lane that opened into the main street had police personnel deployed. There were scores of civil defence personnel. A wonderful view was to see the Policemen riding horses for patrolling. What might have helped to ensure safety and checking any untoward incident was the installation of CCTV cameras on the lampposts. It helped in keeping a tab on the small bunch of mischief-makers and spoilsports.\\n\\nThe duration of the Ganjing Carnival was five hours, starting from 5:00 PM till 10:00 PM. The setup included a central stage at the main crossroad for music and dance performance, which was enough to take away hearts of millions by the dazzling decoration and performance to be conducted. Food court, photo exhibition, selfie zone, art gallery, nukkad natak, flash mobs, kid zone, show your talent are just a few to name. You name it and find it at one or the other place in the overall scenario. The place was not just perfect for the fun lovers but was of equally lively for the food lovers. The food zone was set up in front of L.I.C building, where one can find all kind of food to relish their taste buds starting from the Tunday Kebabi to Raheem’s; from ZamZam Biryani (Meeraj) to Naushijaan, and the icing on the cake were the Prakash Kulfi and Gloria Ice-Cream to beat the scorching heat. Where the youngsters were lost in the music and dance, the aged were going down the memory lane to their times when the older version of carnival used to take place, in 1990s, and continued for a week-long time. It used to start during the Christmas duration and was purely based on the pattern of the Goa carnival. The DJ replaced the cassette players, modern music replaced the shehnai performance, art show replaced the puppet show, and the camel rides etc were a few changes that took place in the years that followed.\\n\\nThe fun filled evening was not only a change for the whole of the Lucknow but also gave city a chance to meet a few exciting and enlightening campaigns and programmes too. When the city was found shaking their head over the grooving music there was too found a bunch of youngsters, volunteering for Global Dreams, who were spearheading a campaign to make Lucknow fully literate and propagating the message of- ‘Each One, Teach One’ among the visitors to eradicate illiteracy. A literacy booth was setup and inaugurated by the CDO, Yogesh Kumar where he made an announcement: “The administration is working hard in association with Devi Sansthan to make Lucknow the first fully literate district”. Not only this, but a bunch of young students from various schools including City International, CMS and City Hall came forward and organized a Nukkad Natak that highlighted the importance of literacy.\\n\\nConsidering present weather conditions, available resources and effort needed to keep the tradition of ‘Ganjing’ alive, district administration has decided to organize the carnival once a month. It was even decided that within three week’s time, even free Wi-Fi service would be provided to the visitors. The services would be available from Parivartan Chowk till the middle of Hazratganj, which would be free for first 20 minutes, and will be charged at a minimal rate after that.\\n\\nThe event was such a huge success among the citizen of Lucknow that the district administration has decided to hold the event once a month during summers and twice a month during rainy season and winters. In summers, the carnival will take place on the second Sunday of month and will be held on alternate Sundays rest of the year. Carnival will not take place during the Lucknow Mahotsava. Accordingly, timing for no traffic zone in Hazratganj was also decided 6pm to 11pm in summer (Mar-Oct) and rainy seasons and 5 pm to 10 pm in winters (Nov-Feb).\\n\\n\\n\\nWEBSITES:\\n\\n1. https://lucknowobserver.com/ganjing-carnival/\\n2. http://lucknowpulse.com/ganjing-carnival-hazratganj-lucknow/#:~:text=The%20duration%20of%20the%20Ganjing%20Carnival%20was,huge%20cutouts%20of%20Lucknow\\'s%20heritage%20buildings%20and\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This is evident in the numerous festivals that are celebrated throughout the year with great pomp and fervour. It is a spiritual place celebrating great festivals with pomp and fervor. The main festivals celebrated in Lucknow are Christmas, Diwali, Eid, Holi, Vrinadavan Sharadotsav, Lucknow Festival, etc. Music of Lucknow is really superb having great influence of ancient traditions. Lucknow is world-wide famous for its classical and folk music as well as dance. The city comes alive with colorful processions, music, and dance during these festivals, creating a sense of unity and joy among its residents. The Fascinating city of Lucknow has ever been associated with a rich tradition of hospitality, exotic cuisine and architectural grandeur. Lucknow attained unparalleled heights of excellence in art, craft and culture during the period of Nawabs. The grandeur and opulence of Lucknow\\'s history have transcended the boundaries of time. This is best visible in the Awadh city\\'s incredible monuments, most of which still echo the whispers of those who dwelled there in the past. Lucknow\\'s rich culture, vibrant arts, crafts and culinary breakthroughs have also been passed down from one generation to another and now, people from across the world come to savour the delights of Awadh. Lucknow\\'s past has been shaped and moulded by its many-faceted forms of art and craft and that\\'s exactly what the Lucknow Mahotsav celebrates- centuries of this Nawabi culture.\\n\\nHere\\'s a glimpse into some of the most prominent cultural festivals and events that Lucknow has to offer:\\n\\n1. Lucknow Mahotsav: \\n(A gala of Nawabi arts, crafts, culture, cuisines & more, Lucknow Mahotsav ties the past with present). Nothing comes as close to telling what Lucknow has been and is all about, as the Lucknow Mahotsav.\\n \\nLucknow Mahotsav is a 10-day long cultural extravaganza held annually in the month of November or December. It showcases the rich cultural heritage of Lucknow through various performances including classical music and dance, ghazals, qawwalis, and traditional folk performances. The festival also features exhibitions, food stalls, and craft displays. Lucknow Mahotsav is organized every year to showcase Uttar Pradesh Art and Culture and in particular Lucknavi \\'Tehzeeb\\' so as to promote Tourism. One of the objectives of the cultural bonanza is to provide encouragement to the Artisans. Craftsmen from all over the country bring their masterpieces to the festival to the delight of shoppers. Colorful processions, traditional dramas, Kathak dances in the style of Lucknow Gharana, Sarangi and sitar recitals, ghazals, qawalis and thumri produce a cheerful atmosphere during the ten-day-long festival. Exciting events like ekka races, kite flying, cockfighting and other customary village games re-establish an ambience of the bygone Nawabi days.\\n\\nLUCKNOW MAHOTSAV TELLS THE TALE OF LUCKNOW\\'S VIBRANT PAST:\\nNothing comes as close to telling what Lucknow has been and is all about, as the Lucknow Mahotsav. A kaleidoscope of craft, couture, culture and cuisine, the 10-day mega fair is a cornucopia of colours and cheers in all forms. It literally transports the visitor to the old world charm of the City of Nawabs, as much as to its modern-day delights. Let us, as proud Lucknowites, take you on a trip down memory lane to trace the origin, past, present and possibly the future of this pageant.\\nIt is instructive to recall, that the year 1975 was observed as the Tourism Year and since then, every year, Lucknow Mahotsav has been organized. Even back then, the carnival held a charm and a vibe that was unmatched by others.\\nSince its humble beginnings, it has become one of the grandest events, not only for Lucknowites welcoming the winters but for thousands of people across the country, many, who use this opportunity to showcase their craft. For us Lucknowites, the Mahotsav marks 10 (or so) days of riveting fun, excitement, a time to reflect on the past and everything that Lucknow is today.\\n\\n\\nBRINGING HINTS OF NOSTALGIA AMID LAKHNAWIS:\\nJust the words \"Lucknow Mahotsav\\'\\' evoke nostalgia and fond remembrance in die-hard Lakhnawis. Mahotsav evenings are remembered by many as gatherings of people from all walks of life, who come to take in the arts of Lucknow, to enjoy the rich Awadhi cuisine, which is symbolic of Lucknow and to catch a fleeting essence of the nawabi culture in the form of Kavi Sammelans, Mushairas and the likes.\\nIn the recent past, Lucknow Mahotsav\\'s festivities have been taken to the next level as national performers and artists have come here to elevate and illuminate Lucknow\\'s forgotten arts and more. These artists come here not only to rekindle the flame of these forgotten arts but to achieve and obtain new heights, to find new meaning within them.\\n\\n\\nMAHOTSAV BRINGS FORTH FORGOTTEN AWADHI ARTS:\\nArtisans who are skilled at the centuries-old Zardari, Chikankari and associated works come here to show their wares. Chikankari is one of Lucknow\\'s most lucrative arts and for good reason. It requires skill, precision and years of training, and the artisans of Lucknow have got it down to a T. Textile art is part of a traditional lifestyle and subtly blends with new-age fashion. When at the Mahotsav, you have to indulge in the simple yet elegant work of chikan artists.\\nAnd then there\\'s the delectable Lucknowi cuisine. Since Lucknow Mahotsav is a celebration of the city\\'s past, there\\'s no way anyone can miss out on the food. Exotic foods and rich cuisines have always been a part of Lucknow\\'s culture, and the Mahotsav delivers. Here, you can get everything from Tunday ke Kebab to Wahid ki Biryani and then some more. Lucknow is nothing short of a foodie\\'s paradise and in the many years of the Mahotsav, we\\'ve learned that we, Lucknow locals, are suckers for our own food.\\nOver the years, Lucknow Mahotsav has expanded its wings to make way for artists, craftsmen and artisans from areas in Uttar Pradesh and the country but the essence of Lucknow, and its charm is not forgotten for a moment. This is perhaps best quantified in the hordes of Lucknowites who come for the Mahotsav from all parts of the city.\\n\\n\\nMAHOTSAV HOLDS A SPECIAL PLACE FOR LUCKNOWITES:\\nIt simply goes to show that Lucknowites are curious about their own city and are always looking to find something new around a corner in Lucknow. The Lucknow Mahotsav brings together the galis of Chowk, the swank localities of Gomti Nagar and everything in between. A city within a city, the Mahotsav has been beckoning us since we were children and has not only shaped what the city is today but also the people. The Mahotsav is a place of discovery and serendipity, a place where time stands still and the past is celebrated, making way for the future to come. At the conclusion of each Mahotsav, Lucknowites walk tall and proud, even as they await with eager anticipation for the next version.\\n \\nHISTORY: \\nThe year 1975-76 was observed and organized in South Asia as The Tourism Year. On this occasion in the motive to promote Lucknow\\'s Art, Culture and Tourism for national and international tourists, the decision to organize the Lucknow Festival was taken. During this period with exception to a few years, Lucknow Mahotsav has been organized every year. Lucknow Mahotsav evening would be adorned with on one hand by the celebrities, famous artists\\' performances and on the other by renounced classical singers. In this program the upcoming local artists have been provided a special representation on the cultural evenings. In addition, the national as well as local Poets/ Shayars have been provided due representation through Kavi Sammelan and Mushayara.\\n\\nCUISINES:\\nMahotsav is a delight for the connoisseurs of good food as it is the ideal place to pamper the taste buds of the visitors with endless varieties of scrumptious dishes as a wide range of cuisines are available at the festival, including Kesaria Doodh, Kabab-parathas and other mouth-watering non-vegetarian exotic dishes.\\n\\nENTERTAINMENT:\\nThe 10 days long festival is one such example. The festival invites many musical as well as comical artists for completing your day in its full sense. The festival celebrated between 25 November and 5 December in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, is a cultural extravaganza. During these 10 days, the entire arena is filled with people enjoying various rides and other poetry/cultural events.\\n\\n\\nAddress: \\nKanshiram Smriti Upwan, Jalvayu Vihar, Ashiyana, Jalvayu Vihar, Lucknow - 226001\\n\\nBusiness Information:\\nLucknow Mahotsav Sthal in Jalvayu Vihar, Lucknow Lucknow Mahotsav Sthal in Lucknow is one of the leading businesses in the Fair Grounds.

Chhappan Bhog: Chhappan Bhog is a unique festival celebrated at the famous temple of Lord Krishna, known as the \"Chhappan Bhog Temple\" located in Lucknow. It usually takes place in the month of August or September. Devotees offer 56 different types of dishes to the deity as part of the rituals, and later these dishes are distributed among the devotees as Prasad (holy food).\\n\\nFood has always been a major part of all our celebrations, large and small. Of them, the Chappan Bhog has to be the heartiest, with as many as 56 dishes prepared for Lord Krishna, during Janmashtami and also for Govardhan puja post Diwali. Every year during this time, thousands of devotees throng Mathura, to offer 56 dishes to appease Krishna.\\n\\nI recall enjoying the feast at some of my neighbours\\' homes when I was a kid. Back then, my food appreciation was limited to meal hopping at my friends\\' houses and exploring the street food of Lucknow. It was only much later that I started exploring the concepts beyond. And that\\'s what led me to explore the story behind the Chappan Bhog.\\n\\nWhy does Chappan Bhog have 56 dishes?\\nLegend has it that Krishna held up the Govardhan mountain for a week to protect villagers and livestock from a torrential thunderstorm caused by the wrath of Lord Indra. As per the legend, Krishna held up the mountain for seven days straight, skipping his usual eight meals a day. Once the rains abated, the villagers offered their thanks by preparing the Annakuta or mountain of food. This was a combination of the eight meals of the day multiplied times seven and hence, fifty-six.\\n\\nIn the book The Eternal Food: Gastronomic ideas and Experiences of Hindus and Buddhists, author Paul M Toomey talks about food “both as the main commodity of the pilgrimage culture and as a communicator of social and religious messages”. I couldn\\'t agree more with the philosophy.\\n\\nWhat goes into a Chappan Bhog?\\nThe typical offerings included in the Chappan Bhog comprise a variety of cereals, fruits and dry fruits, vegetable preparations, sweets, beverages, savouries and chutneys and pickles. However, the actual dishes of the Chapan Bhog vary across regions based on their culinary practices, spiritual connotations and ingredients available. Apart from the customary favourites of butter, yogurt, ghee and rice, there are others that range from sweet: mohan bhog (a semolina halwa), shakkarpara, ghewar, rabri and shrikhand to savoury: khichdi, puri, saag (cooked greens), as well as nuts, papad and chutneys. Of these, the dairy and sweet preparations are placed closest to the deity as they are believed to be dearer to Lord Krishna\\'s palate.\\n\\nBut beyond the concept and legend behind the ritual, there is a larger philosophy at work. One that intrigues me more.\\n\\nOur five fingers have five rasas: sweet, salty, sour, spicy and savoury. When we cook with our hands, these five rasas get transferred to the food. Looking at the larger picture of the Chappan Bhog, I\\'d like to think that this grand feast is a bigger manifestation of those rasas. After all, what better medium to convey and transfer feelings than food? In artistic or literary terms, rasa can be called the aesthetic flavour of any form of art that elicits the desired emotion in the mind of the reader or viewer. Likewise, food is a source of emotion too, it brings joy, it brings back memories, it opens up conversations. When food is prepared for and offered to the gods, it is believed to become even more sacred, having been ‘consumed\\' by the powers above. So, the 56 dishes being ‘accepted\\' by Krishna and then distributed among his devotees is symbolic of the rasas or relationship with him being established.\\n\\nThe contribution of temples towards nurturing local cuisine and preserving our food culture deserves a special mention here. For decades, temples in India have been using the same recipes and cooking techniques, which if not maintained by them, would\\'ve been lost a long time ago. For example, at Jagannath Temple in Puri—believed to have the largest kitchen in the world—the Mahaprasad is still cooked in earthen pots placed in a pyramid over wood fire. Here it is a daily ritual to offer no less than 56 dishes to the deity. The earthen pots retain both flavour and heat uniformly, making the food last for longer periods of time. The menu at the temple is unique in its own way:  there\\'s the simple ukhuda (sugar-coated puffed rice), arisha (fried sweet cake made with rice flour), varieties of bhaja or fritters, a chilli laddoo called maric ladu, dalma (vegetables cooked with lentils), amalu (malpua) and many more.\\n\\nAt the Shri Swaminarayan temple in London, every year the Annakut is a grand display that stretches over seven tiers with more than a thousand dishes, stretching over 85 feet!\\n\\nSo this Krishna Janmashtami, let\\'s seek an emotional completion through these 56 mediums, and celebrate the rasas of our oneness with God with the rasas in food.\\n\\nA Lucknow-based sweetmeat shop has prepared the 56 ‘bhog’ thaali to be offered to the deity, says Acharya Satyendra Das, chief priest of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi\\nLUCKNOW A unique platter of 56 sweet delicacies - ‘Chhappan Bhog’ - has been sent from Lucknow to Ayodhya that will be offered to the deity as a first bhog immediately after the Pran Pratishtha ceremony of Ram Lalla on January 22 .\\n\\nSrajal Gupta of Madhurima Sweets, Lucknow, who curated this unique thaali, said: “We made special ‘Tulsi bhog’ made of tulsi leaves, swarn kalash (sweets with unique gold coating), pistachio barfi, Mysore-pak, mewa bundi laddoo, cashewnut barfi, badam barfi, Kesar barfi, silver coated badam and ilaichi, makhana-pak, mewa panjiri, kaju roast katley, makkhan peda, kesaria misri, milk cake, kesariya gujiya, moti-pak, sohan halwa and many other delicacies.”\\n\\nGupta said he made this offering after speaking to Ram Temple’s chief priest Acharya Satyendra Das. “We handed over the special thaali to him. Acharya told me that the first prasad, which would be offered to Ram after Pran Pratishtha, would be given by him,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.

Born on March 11, 1950, Shiv Murti is one of the leading voices in contemporary Hindi fiction. Hailing from humble background, his life was full of struggle. But the best steel is made when iron is passed in hottest temperature. This holds true for author Shiv Murti. A person of few words, he let his works do the talking for him. His first story ‘Mujhe Jeena Hai’ followed by ‘Paanphool’ was published when he was studying in 12th standard. Thereafter he never looked back. His works depict the plight of rural folk in true light. Caste politics, power politics, poverty and Dalit problems form the theme of his works. One of his best novels ‘Triyacharitra’ portrays the life of a young girl who is false implicated for having an illicit relationship and as a consequence has to bear the brutal punishment handed out by gram panchayat. This novel was later made into a movie by Basu Chatterjee. Since his works paint a picture of rural life in true fervor, his fans consider him as second Premchand. But he brushes aside this compliment saying: “Premchand is Premchand. I can never replace him.” His other novels are Trishul and Tarpan. Keshar Kasturi is a collection of stories authored by him. Now his fans should gear up for the re- release of his novel ‘Akhiri Chhalang’. Shivmurti has won Kathakram and Hans award in the past. Though he is satisfied with the kind of Hindi works produced today, he expresses concern at the youngsters losing interest in Hindi literature.\\n\\nThe Pride of Lucknow award for excellence in women empowerment was bestowed on Madhvi Kuckreja, a social worker and founder of NGO Vanaangan. Humbled to receive the award, she considers herself fortunate to have won it though she had shifted her base to Lucknow only few years back. She has set up a shop, Sanatkada here that sells handicrafts, functions as a café, a book club and a film club, all rolled into one. Madhvi has supported numerous women-led, grassroots-level organizations to emerge as transparent, vibrant entities that are sensitive to women. Internationally, she has worked on building opinion against women being subjected to violence in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka and Sudan. Before moving to Lucknow, she was earlier working in Bundelkhand for alleviating the problems of Dalit women, who are entangled in triad of poverty, caste discrimination and gender subjugation. Though they have been financially independent for long, Dalit women are subjected to discrimination and violence in all forms manifesting itself through rape, public humiliation, or honor killings. Another common punishment for breaking community rules that is also used simply for vengeance is public stripping and parading of women. Violence can also take an extreme form with lynching of women labeled as witches or dayans. Domestic violence however, cuts through religious, caste and class boundaries-dowry related death caused by “accidental” burning of women thrives in the state. Moreover, when women gain property rights-usually after being widowed-they become targets of violence by members of the family or community. Therefore, instead of being economically empowering, property is itself a reason for violence against women. She expresses satisfaction that Due to the collective efforts of her NGO, knowledge levels among Dalit women have increased and they are assuming leadership roles in the village community.\\n\\nThe third Pride of Lucknow award was conferred on noted Urdu author Anees Ashfaq. His work ‘Dukhyare’ highlighting his close relationship with elder brother carries the undertones of declining affluent culture of Lucknow. Elated though to receive the award, he considers ‘Qalam’ as his biggest award. “My writings are useless until they fail to strike a chord with genuine readers,” he said on his felicitation. So what make him pursue writing in Urdu? “I was an avid reader at the age of 18-19. Credit goes to my mother for imparting me lessons in Urdu and shaping my language as it is today.” He expresses concern at the declining habit of reading in today’s youngsters and their overriding ambitions to become stars overnight. He, however, lauds the initiative of Lucknow Society and stresses such rendezvous should be encouraged as they serve as a platform to bring genuine writers together and instills awareness among people. His writings reflect genuine critical analysis of the contemporary scenario. He believes that writings on Lucknow today are not portraying it in true light. With his desire for cultural revival of the city, his upcoming next novel is also set in Lucknow.\\n\\nWith conferring of these four awards, honouring of the dignitaries at the festival came to an end. We at Lucknow Society are thrilled to award best of talent in the city and will continue to reward blossoming excellence in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\nTEAM (2017):\\n\\nOur Patron:\\nDr. Aziz Qureshi\\nEx.

Lucknow Dance and Music Festival: Organized by the Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department, the Lucknow Dance and Music Festival showcases classical dance forms like Kathak, Bharatanatyam, Odissi, and various musical performances. It aims to promote the traditional arts of India and is usually held in the month of February.\\n\\nMusic and dance in Lucknow has been much influenced by the Mughal rule India. The kings were known to lead a life of pleasure and their main source of entertainment was to indulge in music and dance. The royal courts had some of the best dancers and musicians of Lucknow. The performances in dance & music in Lucknow was something that was worth watching. Even today, various artists all over India keep Lucknow music and dance alive. The realm of fine arts flourished during the Mughal rule and Lucknow emerged as one of the best places to indulge in music and dance.\\nLucknow is famous for its collection of classical music that is called as Hindustani classical music. The various ragas, compositions and beats were highly inspired by the poetry written by the famous poets and literary figures. Lucknow traditional music is highly evolved and every detail is taken into attention while singing so as to impart the right feel and the meaning.\\nThe famous Lucknow Gharana was created in the royal courts of the Nawabs of Lucknow. This Gharana inspired major dance forms like Kathak, which is the classical dance of the north of India. Today, the rich tradition of music and dance of Lucknow is kept alive by various exponents and preachers through various concerts and cultural programmes.\\n\\n\\nThe Mahindra Sanatkada Festival in Lucknow offers a variety of cultural events, including dastaangoi, music, dance, and theatre, as well as literary sessions, shopping, and food. The festival showcases the sweetness and uniqueness of the Lucknowi zubaan (language) and highlights the art and craft of the region. Visitors can also enjoy a wide range of food options from popular food joints. The festival will culminate with the Awadhi Home Cooked Food Festival. \\n\\nThe ongoing Mahindra Sanatkada Festival has come up with a blend of cultural events during the five-day event that is underway at Safed Baradari, Kaiserbagh. From dastaangoi, music, dance to theatre there is a lot being offered to the visitors besides the literary sessions, shopping and food. We bring out the action from the opening day. Dastango Mehmood Abdi, a lawyer by profession, says that sweetness in Lucknowi zubaan is a beautiful amalgamation of Hindi and Urdu and Awadhi dialect. “Jo sweetness hai Lucknow ki zubaan mein wo Awadhi se ayi hai. The strength of our language is such that even in a crowd Lucknowites could be singled out when they speak,” says Abdi. He also talked about taqsali zubaan (as a coin minting unit was established in Chowk area) which diluted purity of language like nihari became nahari, taqt became thakat and so on. Lucknowite Askari Naqvi presented three ghazals of Meer Taqi Meer. He was well-supported by Naveen Mishra, Mohd Rafi, Tushar Sahai, Harshwardhan Singh Negi, Aditya Pratap Singh, Aaditya and Abhieraj Shahi. \\n\\n“Tried adding a new dimension to my strength of performance such as dastaangoi and sozkhwani. This is the first time I have performed with a band which plays mix of classical instruments like sitar, tabla and shehnai along with modern devices,” shares Askari. The play Taking Threads,held at the Baradari by Swatantra Talim, team turned out to be a well-curated act where live display of threads, weaving, sharp script, strong narration and smart acts were elegantly weaved together to showcase the life of artisans. The play was inspired by real-life stories of women artisans of chikan-kaarigari . \\n\\n“We have curated events that highlight art and craft in literal sense. Such meaningful presentations create awareness about our indigenous crafts,” says Sanatkada founder Madhvi Kuckreja. Besides, Neelakshi Rai captivated the audience with her kathak performance on songs like Chupke Chupke Raat Din and Hamari Atariya Pe. The attraction for visitors at the fest is not just the shopping and cultural arena. Options are available at the Baradari open area and at the Salempur House lawns. “We tried light options like chaat, piping hot pakori besides the home-cooked snacks at Naimatkhan stall. But the real action is at the lawns where kebabs and kulcha-nihari stalls are set up. The perfect ending was with Kashmiri chai with malai,” adds a visitor, Umesh Gupta. Popular food joints like Raheem’s, Tundey Kababi, Tiwari Chaat and Ah So Yum have been placed at the venue. From dimsums, bao, sushi, Rajasthani food, home-cooked khichda and Awadhi food, options are aplenty.The highlight of the Sunday afternoon will be the most awaited Awadhi Home Cooked Food Festival, that sees a big turnout of foodies.\\n\\nA puzzle, a riddle, an emotion, a passion, a way of life for some, a waste of time for others. It has a thousand names and as many meanings. It inspires great works of art, moves mountains, demolishes kingdoms; it also manifests in sweet nothings, a stolen look, a dried flower in a forgotten book, that crumbles upon touch. It’s universal and personal, unbearable longing and indescribable ecstasy, vulnerable as a teardrop, defiant as a mountain top.\\n\\nLove is definitely what has kept us going for 15 years to bring you this labour of love, this celebration of Lucknow and of handicrafts, this beautiful, chaotic, potpourri of experiences that is the Mahindra Sanatkada Lucknow Festival. And if you haven’t already guessed by now, the theme for this year’s exploration is Aashiqana Lucknow.\\n\\n“na haarā hai ishq aur na duniyā thakī hai diyā jal rahā hai havā chal rahī hai”\\n\\nHere’s to walking through a city that is aashiqana not only in its people and places but also in its stories, memories, food, art, language and cityscapes. Why aashiqui, though? Some say aashiqui is synonymous with peace, and some say junoon. But the beauty of aashiqui lies in how there are multiple layers of emotions leading to diverse interpretations and manifestations of it. Aashiqui is not right, not wrong, it just is.\\n\\nCome celebrate aashiqui with us. And while we’re at it, let\\'s experience Ishq-e-Majazi, Ishq-e-Haqiqi and all things in between, walking the tight ropes of humanity and the social fabric that it exists in, all against the backdrop of a very Aashiqana Lucknow.\\n\\nThe much-awaited MSLF is back in its 15th edition and yes it has all the usual sights, sounds\\n\\nand experiences that you have come to love over the years.

That means if a farmer exports mangoes to Russia, he will get a net profit of more than Rs 600. We have to take the mangoes from here to every corner of the world. The markets of Europe are waiting for the mangoes from UP.\" He asked the farmers to avoid shortcuts, prioritise quality, and prepare their products in accordance with market demands. \"Our government is working on the Beej Se Bazar Tak\\' (from seed to market) approach to increase the income of farmers.\\nThe CM said that during the Global Investors Summit, the government sent teams to a number of countries. \"We have to explore the global market for horticulture crops, and through Indian Missions abroad, we should organise exhibitions showcasing agricultural products related to UP,\" he said.\\nAsserting that the mango festival is a platform to increase the income of farmers, he said, \"As per Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s intention, the UP government is taking all necessary steps in the interest of the farmers.\"\\nYogi said, \"Our government has built four-pack houses in the state. Recently, we got the\\nopportunity to send two tonnes of mangoes to Dubai from the pack house in Varanasi, and we will have to organise similar program in the pack houses in Saharanpur, Amroha, and Lucknow.\" He said that in order to bring horticulture crops to the international market, agricultural scientists and officers of the Horticulture Department will need to work together. \"Only then will we be able to explore new avenues and give the agricultural and horticultural products of UP a different identity,\" he said.\\nProducers, buyers, sellers, and exporters participated in the mango festival.

The Ganjing Carnival: \\n\\nThe Celebration of ‘Hazratganj Sundays’: \\n\\nThe Lucknow Ganjing Carnival was started in 2015 by Lucknow District Administration to give back the city its old world charm of Nawabi era and Victorian feel. The carnival, which is organized once a month during summer season and twice a month during winter season at Mahatma Gandhi Marg in Hazratganj, encapsulates all the distinctive features of Hazratganj of the bygone era. Artists can demonstrate their talent from a large stage, which is set up in front of multi-level parking. The stage is also used for various musical, dance and cultural performances by popular celebrity-artists. Visitors can watch movies based on Lucknow’s history and culture at Soochna Kendra Library office in Hazratganj. Nukkad natak, art gallery, selfie zone, kid zone, photo exhibition, to name a few, are some of the highlights of the carnival. Food enthusiasts can relish their taste buds at the food stalls, starting from Raheem’s, Tunday Kebabi, Wahid Biryani, Naushi-jaan, Moti Mahal and Prakash Kulfi.\\n\\nThe Ganjing Carnival is a five-hour event in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh that celebrates the heritage of Hazratganj, a shopping area in the city. The carnival includes music and dance performances, food courts, an art gallery, photo exhibitions, and selfie zones. The district administration has decided to organize the carnival once a month, with each month having a different theme. \\n\\nThe carnival features standard features such as a food court, art gallery, handicraft, talent hunt, and photo exhibition. The carnival also includes selfie zones with large cutouts of Lucknow\\'s heritage buildings. \\n\\nThe carnival celebrates Hazratganj\\'s 200-year history. Hazratganj is one of Lucknow\\'s oldest and most iconic areas, with a rich history dating back to the time of the Nawabs of Awadh. The area was originally known as Ganj-e-Sabun, which means \"soap market,\" as it was a hub for soap makers during the 18th century. Hazratganj is now a major Victorian-style shopping area that houses showrooms, shopping complexes, restaurants, hotels, cafés, theaters, offices, and businesses. \\n\\nA stroll or window shopping at Lucknow’s oldest and prestigious shopping destination, Hazrat Ganj, is often known as Ganj-ing. Hazratganj, the 200+ year old elite shopping and entertainment zone, has seen quite a happening past. In 1810, the first nawab of Awadh, Saadat Ali Khan, brought up the idea of such a place. After him, it was Nawab Nasiruddin Haider who nurtured this dream and commissioned many buildings and Kothis in Hazrat Ganj. Earlier called Munnawar Baksh probably because of Munnawar Kothi built there, the area was renamed to Hazrat Ganj in 1842, drawing from the nickname of Nawab Amjad Ali Shah who was often lovingly called “Hazrat”.\\n\\nThere was a time when Hazrat Ganj had a distinctive charm with a fine blend of mughal architecture and a victorian feel in the buildings, sidewalks, and even the vehicles and horse-carriages used by the nawabs and the British officers. Pedestrians too used to enjoy the walk across the shops, movie theatres, ball room, clock tower, and the coffee house. Today, if we need to relive that era, Hazratganj, the heritage area of Lucknow, needs to be transformed for a while. District Administration of Lucknow did just that when they planned the Ganjing Carnival at Hazratganj Lucknow.\\n\\nOn Sunday May 24, 2015, Hazratganj was made out of bounds for any kind of vehicles from the main crossroad near GPO till the office of the Chief Post Master General. The duration of the Ganjing Carnival was five hours, starting from 5:00 PM till 10:00 PM. District administration put up a great show by setting up stages for Music and Dance performances, Food courts, Art gallery, photo exhibitions, selfie zones with huge cutouts of Lucknow’s heritage buildings and lots more.\\n\\nThe excitement among the crowds was worth taking a note. Lucknowites were flocking in with family members and friends, posing for Picture of lucknow policemen patrolling on horseback at the Ganjing Carnivalpictures, enjoying the food and music, amidst the confidence that they were safe and free to roam about the long stretch of the main street – M.G.Road. Every sidelane that opened    into the main street had police personnel deployed. There were scores of civil defence personnel. A wonderful view was to see the Policemen riding horses for patrolling. What might have helped to ensure safety and  checking any untoward incident was the installation of CCTV cameras on the lamp-posts. It helped in keeping a tab on the small bunch of mischief-makers and spoilsports.\\n\\nThe event was such a huge success among the citizen of Lucknow that the district administration has decided to hold the event once a month during summers and twice a month during rainy season and winters.\\n\\n\\nAny historical city in the world stands out because of its heritage, culture, cuisine, languages, dialects, people and the typical style of living. Lucknow city, a unique concoction of all such factors is also a representative of the British influence that makes Lucknow a well-known city on the map of Indian tourism. Every city bears a disparate blend of charm and essence, an air about their ambiences, which are its earmark and make them unique in its own way. The parks, markets, monuments, public buildings, which are the essential part of the identity of any city.\\n\\nHazratganj is not only a market, but also a representative of the city’s rich heritage and culture, which still continues to attract the generation as it used to era’s back. The true essence of the Nawabi era can be relished completely by spending an evening at this place. This ravishments evening can be termed as ‘Ganjing’ and one can truly comprehend with it if he/she is a true Lucknowite at heart.\\n\\nThe 200+ year-old elite shopping and entertainment zone has seen quite a happening past. It was in 1810 that nawab of Oudh, Saadat Ali Khan came up with such a place in his mind and this dream of his was nurtured by Nawab Naseer-ud-Din Haider who is accredited with construction of numerous Kothis and buildings in that area. The area known by the name Munawwar Baksh, probably because of Munawwar Kothi of that are was later on renamed to Hazrat Ganj years later in 1842, rendering its name from the fourth king of Oudh, Amjad Ali Shah who was often lovingly called ‘Hazarat’\\n\\nAs the marketplace witnessed 100 years of its completion, it saw a massive changeover in European style designed buildings. In order to bring uniformity the complete area was repainted into the same colour-coordinated theme of cream and pink, benches were fixed at every few metres along with elegant European style lampposts and fountains and railings that replicate the Victorian age broad walk. The motive behind this beautification was to uplift and restore the dying popularity of the place. The idea was to restore the place back in its ancient and traditional look along with a touch of modernity.\\n\\nThe District Administration of Lucknow just decided to give back Lucknow its old charm of the perfect blend of the Mughal era and the Victorian feel when they planned the Ganjing Carnival, encapsulating almost all the lineaments of the Hazratganj of the bygone era.\\n\\nIt was on Sunday, May 24, 2015, that Hazratganj witnesses a massive change, the roads were made out of bound for all kind of vehicles, from the main crossroad near GPO till the office of the Chief Post Master General. The announcement of Hazratganj being a no vehicle zone on Sundays along the stretch has already brought back excitement around the boulevard, particularly to those who prefer Hazratganj over swanky shopping malls.\\n\\nThe preparation began from the early morning itself and what lead to the place by the evening left everyone awe struck. The excitement among the crowds was worth taking a note. It was an initiative that was taken to bring the city together for not only reviving the good old days but to inculcate togetherness, joy, laughter, song and what not to count, among the clan and the kin, but coming together of 30,000 souls on a hot summer evening in the heart of the city was surely one unexpected thing to witness. The scorching heat was of no good to keep the enthusiasm of the Youngers to a restricted zone or timing. The city saw the best of fashion and spirit combined in this one evening. The cherry on the cake was a remarkable management of the show with no report of crime or any kind of uneventful circumstances. Every side lane that opened into the main street had police personnel deployed. There were scores of civil defence personnel. A wonderful view was to see the Policemen riding horses for patrolling. What might have helped to ensure safety and checking any untoward incident was the installation of CCTV cameras on the lampposts. It helped in keeping a tab on the small bunch of mischief-makers and spoilsports.\\n\\nThe duration of the Ganjing Carnival was five hours, starting from 5:00 PM till 10:00 PM. The setup included a central stage at the main crossroad for music and dance performance, which was enough to take away hearts of millions by the dazzling decoration and performance to be conducted. Food court, photo exhibition, selfie zone, art gallery, nukkad natak, flash mobs, kid zone, show your talent are just a few to name. You name it and find it at one or the other place in the overall scenario. The place was not just perfect for the fun lovers but was of equally lively for the food lovers. The food zone was set up in front of L.I.C building, where one can find all kind of food to relish their taste buds starting from the Tunday Kebabi to Raheem’s; from ZamZam Biryani (Meeraj) to Naushijaan, and the icing on the cake were the Prakash Kulfi and Gloria Ice-Cream to beat the scorching heat. Where the youngsters were lost in the music and dance, the aged were going down the memory lane to their times when the older version of carnival used to take place, in 1990s, and continued for a week-long time. It used to start during the Christmas duration and was purely based on the pattern of the Goa carnival. The DJ replaced the cassette players, modern music replaced the shehnai performance, art show replaced the puppet show, and the camel rides etc were a few changes that took place in the years that followed.\\n\\nThe fun filled evening was not only a change for the whole of the Lucknow but also gave city a chance to meet a few exciting and enlightening campaigns and programmes too. When the city was found shaking their head over the grooving music there was too found a bunch of youngsters, volunteering for Global Dreams, who were spearheading a campaign to make Lucknow fully literate and propagating the message of- ‘Each One, Teach One’ among the visitors to eradicate illiteracy. A literacy booth was setup and inaugurated by the CDO, Yogesh Kumar where he made an announcement: “The administration is working hard in association with Devi Sansthan to make Lucknow the first fully literate district”. Not only this, but a bunch of young students from various schools including City International, CMS and City Hall came forward and organized a Nukkad Natak that highlighted the importance of literacy.\\n\\nConsidering present weather conditions, available resources and effort needed to keep the tradition of ‘Ganjing’ alive, district administration has decided to organize the carnival once a month. It was even decided that within three week’s time, even free Wi-Fi service would be provided to the visitors. The services would be available from Parivartan Chowk till the middle of Hazratganj, which would be free for first 20 minutes, and will be charged at a minimal rate after that.\\n\\nThe event was such a huge success among the citizen of Lucknow that the district administration has decided to hold the event once a month during summers and twice a month during rainy season and winters. In summers, the carnival will take place on the second Sunday of month and will be held on alternate Sundays rest of the year. Carnival will not take place during the Lucknow Mahotsava. Accordingly, timing for no traffic zone in Hazratganj was also decided 6pm to 11pm in summer (Mar-Oct) and rainy seasons and 5 pm to 10 pm in winters (Nov-Feb).\\n\\n\\n\\nThese festivals and events not only provide entertainment but also offer a glimpse into the rich cultural tapestry of Lucknow, making them an integral part of the city\\'s identity.\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It was the first king of Awadh clan - Ghazi-ud-Din Haider, who constructed this historical site in Lucknow. He built the Imambara as a token of his devotion to Hazrat Ali, who was the son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad. Shahnajaf Imambara is a replica of Ghazi-ud-Din’s own tomb in Iraq. At present, Shahnajaf Imambara is one of the main tourist attractions in Lucknow mainly because of its historical significance and impressive architecture. Near the Imambara, a house and a mosque for Mumtaz Mahal (his wife) were also constructed by Ghazi-ud-Din Haider. However, in the year 1913, the house was torn down to construct a road on the riverside. Inside the Imambara, there lie the remains of him as he wanted to be buried here. Along with that, the graves of his wives Mubarak Mahal, who died in 1849, Sarfaraz Mahal who died in 1878, and Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1896. On 13th of Rajab (birthday of Hazrat Ali) and between 7th and 9th Muharram, the Imambara is beautifully decorated.\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nConstructed in the year 1816 - 1817, Shahnajaf Imambara is the mausoleum of Haider Ali and his three wives. However, the aim to build this Imambara was to create a place for Azadari (mourning for the sacrifice of Imam Hussain).\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nComing on to the architecture of this popular tourist place in Lucknow, the Imambara boasts a strong influence of Mughal architectural style. However, the highlight of the architecture of this Imambara is the large dome which is unique in its shape. Unlike other domes, the neck of the dome is not slender but is onion-shaped. Along with that, there is also a doorway at both front and back side of the Imambara.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLocation Address\\r\\nRana Pratap Marg, Hazratganj, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226001, India.\\r\\nVisiting Timings\\r\\nShahnajaf Imambara remains open all days a week. One can visit the place on any day between 6:00 AM and 5:00 PM.\\r\\nEntry Fee\\r\\nNo Entry Fee\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-Charbagh Railway Station Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are very few cities in India whose railway stations are themselves major tourist attractions. The Charbagh Railway Station located in Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh, is one of them. This enormous structure of red and white, with its turrets, domes and towers, is an impressive sight, and another reminder of glorious heritage in Lucknow. There is no pretension of modesty about it, with its grand proportions overseeing the onlooker at first sight.\\r\\nThis railway station, which is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places to visit in Lucknow, is called Char Bagh (four gardens) because of the four gardens which are believed to have existed here till 1867. Of them, one garden still exists today, and is located just across the railway station. Spacious and large, the park complements the beauty of the railway station significantly.\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nThe foundations for the Charbagh Railway Station was laid on 21st March, 1914 by Bishop George Herbert, with its design planned by J.H. Hornimen. However, it took 9 years for the construction of the railway station to be completed in 1923. The entire investment for the structure was about 70 lakh rupees. C.L.Colvin, a famous agent of the British East India Company, placed a casket inside the turret of the building which contained a coin and newspaper of those times. It was meant to serve as a reminder of the successful completion of the building. Today, an old railway engine stands at the exit gate of the railway station, transporting us back to the days of steam engines.\\r\\nThe Charbagh Railway Station in Lucknow has also witnessed some memorable episodes of Indian history. It was here that Mahatma Gandhi first met Jawaharlal Nehru and participated in the opening session of the legislature of Congress. This railway station was once again graced by the noble presence of Gandhiji when he attended yet another session of the Congress legislature held here.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nThe Charbagh Railway Station is one of the most beautiful railway stations in India. Its architectural style suggests a combination of various styles including Mughal, Rajput and Awadhi. Another interesting fact about this railway station is that when viewed aerially, it resembles a chess board, with the domes, pillars and turrets appearing like chess pieces on a board. There are various tunnels below the station which are today used for the purpose of transporting goods. It is also believed that if you stand on the porch of the station, you will not hear the noise of incoming and outgoing trains.

If you dislike hot weather, obviously, this is not the proper time to plan a holiday. During the winter season, the weather becomes cool, pleasant and amicable. For many visitors, this is the best time to plan a trip to Lucknow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-The Residency Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the residence for the British Resident General and now a popular tourist landmark in the Lucknow city, is The Residency. Also touted as the Residency Complex and British Residency, it is basically a group of buildings in one enclosure. Overlooking the River Gomti, this historical site in Lucknow is engirdled by gorgeous gardens and lawns. On a whole, the Residency is an architectural marvel in the city of Lucknow. One of the most interesting things to know about the Residency is that it has been a significant part of the Seige of Lucknow (1857); the ruins of which can still be seen at the site. The front gate of the complex was referred to as the Baillie guard gate. The name of this gateway was kept after Col. John, the first resident of the British Residency. However, in the initial days of this complex, there was a practice of Guard of Honour that was started by the Nawab of that time. Besides the gate, there lie the ruins of The Treasury. Though this part was used to serve as a warehouse of wretched cartridges during the war of 1857, yet, it is one of the main features of this popular tourist attraction in Lucknow.On one of the walls of the complex, a marble plaque is inscribed that honours the troops that fought with bravery. This memorial is believed to be built later unlike the other parts of the building, since it is intact. The Residency complex houses graves of around 2000 soldiers that sacrificed their lives during the war of 1857. \\r\\nAt present, this famous heritage attraction in Lucknow is serving as a government office. It also includes a museum along with the tomb of Saadat Ali Khan - the first Nawab of Awadh. Within the complex, Kaisarbagh Palace and an observatory are two more key features. Apart from this, the building complex also includes a mosque, Imambara, a brigade mess, Ommaney’s house, judicial post, Anderson’s post and Sago’s house.\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nThe construction of the Residency was started in the late 1700s by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah, however, it was completed by Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. After a few years of the construction, it became British personnels’ hub. In the initial years, they were just the delegates of the East India Company. However, as the reign of British East India expanded, the city of Lucknow became their administrative centre, and as an effect of that, the Residency also came under the British commissioner of Awadh. The biggest event that this place has been a part of, is the first war of Independence which held in the year 1857. One of the main centres of this entire siege was Lucknow and the main target was The Residency. Cannons and bullets destroyed the major part of this place and even today, the traces of that revolt can still be seen at The Residency.\\r\\nEntry Fee\\r\\nThe entry fee to The Residency varies for both Indian and foreign tourists.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Indians: The entry fee is 5 INR per head\\r\\nFor Foreigners: The entry fee is 100 INR per head\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nThe Residency is a set of buildings that are enclosed in a large compound. It includes armoury, quarters, stables, worship places, residential quarters, dispensaries and so on. However, one of the key features of this must-visit place in Lucknow is the Banquet Hall that was also built by the Nawab. The hall boasts the intricate carvings of tall arches along with high ceilings and large hallways. At the back, there is open space which was used as the kitchen in that era. Coming on to the entrance of the Residency, there is a beautiful fountain in the centre that perfectly complements the beauty of the place. Nearby the banquet hall, there is located the house of Dr Frayer that also served as the hideout for the British families during the revolt of 1857. The house has a basement which is said to be used as a hiding place for the children and women. However, during the war, the house was often used as the hospital. Above all that, the main building is the must-see thing at the Residency. It was once the imposing three-storey building that used to have a library, games room and offices. Besides, at the front of the main building, there is located a large memorial cross which was built for MG Sir John Inglis along with his wife Julia. He died in the siege of Lucknow.\\r\\nLocation Address\\r\\nMahatma Gandhi Marg, Deep Manak Nagar, Qaiserbagh, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226001, India.\\r\\nVisiting Timings\\r\\nThe Residency remains open all days a week. One can visit the place on any day from 7 in the morning to 6 in the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-Dilkusha Kothi Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\nEven though much of Dilkusha Kothi lies in ruins today, it still exudes that stately aura which suggests it being a structure of immense historical and cultural significance. It has witnessed some of the most thrilling episodes of Indian history. History lovers or not, this is a monument which you should visit during your trip to Lucknow. This monument was built in the 18th century by Major Gore Ouseley, the British resident and a good friend to the then ruler of Oudh, Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. It was initially built as a hunting lodge for the Nawabs, although it also served the function of a summer resort. Because of its close proximity to the river, the Dilkusha Kothi, which still is one of the popular tourist attractions in Lucknow, was also used as a place where the Begums (wives of Nawabs) came to relax, unwind and enjoy a picnic. It is interesting to note however, that this place did not have a separate zenana (ladies’ room), a feature common to all Nawabi buildings. \\r\\nThis structure has fascinated people from all over the globe since the earliest times. It was from this place that William Howard Russell, an acclaimed correspondent of The Times, said that Lucknow was the most beautiful city he had ever come across, adding that its beauty exceeded that of Rome, Athens and Constantinople. And this, at a time when the building was damaged by the exchange of heavy artillery fire between the Indian sepoys and the British forces during the Indian Revolt of 1857. This magnificent structure also charmed Mary Linley Taylor, a famous British actress, who was so impressed by it that she named her home in Seoul after it. \\r\\nThe building went further changes under the rule of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah (the tenth and last Nawab of Awadh). It was he who, during the early years of his rule, built another Kothi just next to it. This was done so that he could hold military exercises for his troops. However, the British were very offended by this act and ordered him to stop all further exercises. This left the Nawab quite helpless and frustrated. It was not too later that he was forced to abdicate by the British. Before doing so, he also refused to sign his abdication statement, following which, he was illegally deposed. \\r\\nUpon visiting the Dilkusha Kothi today, you can but be moved by the sight of it and the events which occurred at this very spot. It is as if the structure bemoans a loss of lost lives and the sacrifices made. An emptiness pervades the atmosphere, and in the midst of it all, you are overcome by nostalgia.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nMuch of the Dilkusha Kothi is in ruins today. However, take a quick look at its walls and towers, and you are instantly reminded of its grand past. The design of this structure bears a striking resemblance to Seaton Delaval Hall, an amazing country house located in Northumberland, England. \\r\\nThis 18th century house was originally a three-storeyed structure which also housed a mini-basement. There were four ornamental octagonal towers whose entrance was marked by an impressive flight of steps. These then led to a central doorway which rested on tall pillars which are as high as the roof of the second storey. Another notable feature of the structure which lent it a similarity to Claude Martin, was the presence of female statues near the balustrades. The perfectly manicured gardens outside the Kothi greatly add to its beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPopular Tourist Attractions Nearby\\r\\nThere are a lot of tourist attractions in Lucknow which offer various opportunities for sightseeing and exploration. After visiting the Dilkusha Kothi, there are some of the other places which you can check out. \\r\\n\\r\\nLord Hanuman Temples of Aliganj\\r\\nCharbagh Railway Station\\r\\nGurudwara Yahiyaganj\\r\\nSikandar Bagh\\r\\nNational Botanical Research Institute\\r\\nVidhan Bhawan\\r\\nJain Temple\\r\\nLa Martiniere\\r\\nBuddha Temple\\r\\nShaheed Smarak\\r\\n\\r\\nBest Time to Visit\\r\\nDilkusha Kothi is located in the city of Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh. During the summers, it can get extremely hot during the summers, with the average temperature being 42°C. The heat can be a daunting factor for many people. If, however, you are not too troubled with the heat, you can certainly visit Lucknow during this time. If you prefer cool, pleasant and inviting weather, then winters is the time to plan a trip to the city of Lucknow, as you can enjoy sightseeing at leisure.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-Sikandar Bagh Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\nToday, it is difficult to believe that Sikandar Bagh, one of the most popular tourist attractions in Lucknow, was the site of a fierce battle between the British and Indian forces. At one point of time, though, it was a cultural center, hosting plays, music, dances and poet competitions throughout the year. Visit it in the morning, and you come across people of all ages enjoying a leisurely walk, playing games or just spending some quiet time.\\r\\nSikandar Bagh is spread over an area of 120 square yards and was built by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Oudh, as his summer residence. According to some people, it was named Sikandar after Alexander the Great, while others say that it was named after Sikandar Mahal Begum, the favourite wife of the Nawab. Even after the raids and attacks conducted on it, it exudes a kind of magnificence which is to be found in all such structures dating back to that era. This garden is a part of the National Botanical Research Institute.\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nDuring the Indian Revolt of 1857, Sikandar Bagh served as a major stronghold for the Indian troops during their siege of the British Residency in Lucknow. The fierce battle which occurred here claimed more than two thousand lives. A particularly notable incident is worth mentioning in this regard because it sheds light on the exemplary bravery displayed by the women soldiers of Begum Hazrat Mahal. The entire scene was described by an eyewitness who went by the name of Sergeant William Forbes Mitchell. He says that there was an enormous peepal tree in the garden, beneath which there were water jars placed for the soldiers to quench their thirst.\\r\\nAfter one such episode of fighting, the Sergeant noticed the scattered bodies of English soldiers at a particular spot. Having examined the wounds, he reached the conclusion that every one of these soldiers had been shot from above. He ordered a soldier by the name of Wallace to see if anybody was lodged in that tree. Sure enough, he spotted a person and fired. The body landed on the ground with a loud thud, and upon discovering that it was a woman, was immediately filled with remorse. What he said next reflected the immense grief that he was immersed in, \"If I had known it was a woman, I would rather have died a thousand deaths than have harmed her\".\\r\\nAlthough the identity of the woman was never ascertained, there was a monument built in her memory. A bust with the name of “unknown heroine” is located inside the premises of the park and reminds visitors of the supreme sacrifice and valour displayed by her. Here is another interesting fact associated with the monument. A year after the Sikandar Bagh was stormed, an Italian-British photographer by the name of Felice Beato captured the recently damaged structure in her photograph. Looking at the photo, one can well imagine the intensity of the fighting which occurred here, while its overall charm is enhanced by the fact that it was shot almost two hundred years back.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nSikandar Bagh is located in close proximity to the National Botanical Research Institute, another famous tourist attraction in Lucknow. The entire structure was built at a cost of approximately 5 lakh rupees. It was once home to a summer palace along with a wooden pavilion. At one point of time, it also housed a mosque inside an enclosure which had huge walls and three lofty gateways on three sides. Today, however, only one of the structures stand, as the rest were completely razed to the ground during the Indian Revolt of 1857.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis gateway is a major attraction inside the Sikandar Bagh, which is one of the most beautiful structures you should visit in Lucknow. It reflects a combination of various architectural styles, from Indian and Persian to European and Chinese. Its interiors are adorned with lovely frescoes which bear a close resemblance to the Chikan embroidery style that Lucknow is famous for. Exquisite examples of art can also be witnessed on the chattris and pagodas. The entire monument is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India and therefore, is of great national importance.\\r\\nPopular Tourist Attractions Nearby\\r\\nThere is no dearth of options when it comes to sightseeing and exploration in Lucknow. After exploring the Sikandar Bagh, here are some of the other famous tourist attractions which you can check out.\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Martiniere\\r\\nBuddha Temple\\r\\nShaheed Smarak\\r\\nDilkusha\\r\\nJain Temple\\r\\nLord Hanuman Temples of Aliganj\\r\\nNational Botanical Research Institute\\r\\nCharbagh Railway Station\\r\\nTombs of Saadat Ali Khan & Khurshid Zadi\\r\\nVidhan Bhawan\\r\\nGurudwara Yahiyaganj\\r\\n\\r\\nBest Time to Visit\\r\\nSikandar Bagh is located in Oudh in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. The best time to visit it entirely depends on you. Of course, as a historical structure, it can be visited throughout the year. During summers though, the weather can get very hot, with the average temperature being 42°C. If the heat doesn’t bother you a lot, you can visit Lucknow during this time. During winters, the weather is cool, pleasant and welcoming. Naturally, sightseeing becomes more enjoyable in the company of such beautiful weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-La Martiniere Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\nLa Martiniere is one of the premier educational institutes in not only in Lucknow but in the country. Its alumni consist of individuals who have achieved excellence in their respective fields and done the country proud time and again. In fact, it is one of the few educational institutions in India which has been depicted on postage stamps. On 1st October, 1955, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, on the occasion of the school’s 150th anniversary, issued a postage stamp in its honour. It is a reflection of the high esteem in which the school was held during those years, and still is today. On your next trip to Lucknow, this is one of the tourist attractions which you should visit as it is an essential part of the city’s heritage.\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nThe history of La Martiniere in Lucknow is quite interesting. The school was founded in 1845 according to the will of Major General Claude Martin. He was born in Lyon in France in 1735 but died in 1800 AD in Lucknow. According to the instructions issued by him, the day of his death was to be celebrated as Founder’s Day. In his will, he also allotted some funds for the establishments of schools in France, Kolkata and Lucknow.\\r\\nThere is another development associated with the school which makes it unique among the other schools in independent India or the erstwhile British Empire. After the death of Claude Martin, his will was the subject of great litigation. The seriousness of the matter required the intervention of the then Supreme Court of Calcutta. The court declared on 11th April, 1839, that a college in Lucknow be established according to his will. Another decree issued by the Supreme Court on 22nd December 1841, led to the setting up of a scheme for the establishment of the college in Lucknow. This is how the college came into existence.\\r\\nThe Indian Revolt of 1857 also had an impact on La Martiniere. Concerned with the rapidly deteriorating situation, the college was shifted to the Residency on 13th June 1857. This was done on the orders of Sir Henry Lawrence. During the attacks by Indian troops, the principal, masters and boys of La Martiniere defended the southern perimeter of the Residency, which was exposed and thus, vulnerable to attacks from outside. They braved hardships and courageously defended The Martiniere Post for five months, while ensuring that they were regular with their studies. Their brave spirits and the exemplary courage shown by them during trying times was acknowledged in 1938 when the college was awarded colors which bore the legendary Defense of Lucknow. Never before, or after, has a school been honored in this way.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nThe school’s infrastructure is a matter of pride, as are its traditions and heritage. Indeed, one is incomplete without the other. La Martiniere boasts two academic campuses, the Junior School Campus and Constantia Campus. The Junior School Campus consists of three academic blocks which houses the pre-school and junior sections. Constantia Campus, on the other hand, houses the middle and senior sections of the school. The accommodations for resident scholars and resident staff are also housed in this part. The construction of the building known as Constantia began in 1796. Although it is not protected by the Archaeological Survey of India, it is a part of the Lucknow Heritage Zone. The founder of the college is buried in the crypt in the basement, while directly above the crypt stands the La Martiniere Memorial Hall. The bust of the Founder, which is an impressive sight in itself, is surrounded by tablets which display the names of the former students who attained martyrdom in Second World War. In their honor, the college was presented by blue and gold battle honors, which are now part of the College Flag.\\r\\nA feature common to all La Martiniere schools across India is the Chapel. The chapel of this college is over a century old. A special feature about the chapel are the two stained glass windows which were presented as a gift by two former students of the college. They depict child Jesus in the Carpenter’s shop along with the doctors of law, emphasizing the importance of honest manual labour along with wisdom.\\r\\nAnother attractive part of the College’s architecture is its east terrace, which is accessed by a grand staircase. It is an artificial lake and from its center juts out a solid fluted column which is almost 125 ft high. Called the Lat, it is associated with several legends as well as theories revolving around its existence. The center of the east terrace is occupied by an enormous canon used in the Battle of Seringapatam in 1792.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a special bell placed on a pedestal. The east terrace also hosts several occasions, including parades and Prize Day. Each step of the stones have been engraved with the names of pupils who have, through the centuries, left their lasting impression in one way or the other.Other notable buildings in the college complex are swimming baths, college hospitals, tombs of Boulone and Major Hudson.\\r\\nPopular Tourist Attractions Nearby\\r\\nAfter paying a visit to La Martiniere, you can visit the other popular tourist attractions in Lucknow.

Agra Lucknow Expressway connects Agra to Lucknow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-Bara Imambara Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\nMughal Emperors and their deputies, the Nawabs, had their own ways of solving problems. The Bara Imambara, for example, was constructed to tackle the onset of one such famine. Built by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula between the years 1785 and 1791 AD, the main objective behind building it was to provide employment to the people. There are several interesting tales associated with this structure, which is undeniably one of the most beautiful heritage attractions in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. According to one of those, common people worked during the day to build up its base, while noblemen and other members of the elite class demolished anything which was built during the night! The purpose behind this was to extend the duration of the work as much as possible, or at least, as long as the famine lasted.\\r\\nWhat we call Bara Imambara is a large mosque complex whose main portion is an enormous hall, apart from the Asfi mosque and Baoli. It houses the graves of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula and his wife Shamsunnisa Begum. Here, Muslims perform their sacred rituals during the Muharram festival, also known as Azadari in the local language. On this day, Muslims mourn the death of Husayn ibn Ali in the battle of Karbala.\\r\\nAs a visitor, you will find many things to admire in the Imambara. However, one particular part of it that will catch your fancy is the Bhool Bhulaiya. It is a labyrinth of interconnected passages and doors which seem to lead into a series of passages. Take care not to venture too deep inside the passageways, though. Stories of people wandering deep into the passageways, never to be found again, are quite common. Some of these passageways lead you into the ceiling from where you can enjoy the spectacular views on the outside. Although most of them have been closed, the safest way of exploring these passageways is through an authorised guide.\\r\\nThere are other attractions inside the mosque complex which promise to keep you engaged throughout the duration of your visit. Other than the Bhool Bhulaiya, there is the stepwell (baoli) and the Asfi mosque that attracts visitors. An interesting fact about the mosque is that it was built without the use of iron by taking the assistance of European experts who were specially called for the purpose.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nThe Bara Imambara is built in the combination of Mughal, Rajput and Gothic architectural styles. Designed by Hafiz Kifayat Ullah, an extremely renowned architect of that time, it is an example of sheer engineering marvel and has no parallel.\\r\\nInside the monument, there are 9 halls in all, out of which, the central hall is the largest. It is the ceiling which deserves a special mention. Standing at a height of almost 15m, it is supported without any columns, iron rods, beams or girders. This was done because the central hall was to be used as a place for prayers. It is undoubtedly the largest unarched hall in the world.\\r\\nThe monument itself is built of Lakhauri bricks which are laid in lime mortar. It is adorned with stucco work along with chattris and parapets. The interior matches, perhaps even exceeds, the exterior, in terms of splendour. Chandeliers, alam, tazias have been used in its decoration. The absence of wood or metal is also very impressive. On all fronts, the Bara Imambara reflects perfection and grandeur in its architecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInteresting Facts\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main hall, or the Central Hall of the Bara Imambara, is the largest unarched hall in the world.\\r\\nMany interconnected passages of the Bhool Bhulaiya were closed to the general public after some people were reported missing.\\r\\nIt is believed that there are secret tunnels in the Bara Imambara which lead directly to the Gomti River, Delhi, Faizabad and Allahabad.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntry Fee\\r\\nThe entry fee for Bara Imambara varies for both domestic and international tourists. For domestic tourists, the entrance fee is 25 INR, while the fee for international tourists is 500 INR.\\r\\nBest Time to Visit\\r\\nBara Imambara is located in Lucknow, in the state of Uttar Pradesh. You can visit it throughout the year, depending on your preferences. During summers, it can get very hot, with the temperature soaring up to 45°C. If hot and dry weather doesn’t bother you, then summer is a perfect time to visit. During winters, though, the weather is cool and pleasant, thus creating the right conditions for exploring the monument. If you enjoy cool weather, then this is the best time to plan a trip to Bara Imambara.\\r\\nNearby Tourist Attractions\\r\\n\\r\\nChowk\\r\\nChota Imambara\\r\\nAurangzeb’s Mosque\\r\\nBritish Residency\\r\\nHazratganj\\r\\nHussainabad Clock Tower\\r\\nRumi Darwaza\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-Colonial Monuments Lucknow\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first contact that British had with Uttar Pradesh was during the rule of the third Nawab of Awadh. Under the British rule, the state that we called Uttar Pradesh was referred to as United Provinces. The important role that this region played in the establishment and expansion of British rule in India is only too well documented.\\r\\nAll throughout that role, the British built some magnificent structures. Inspired by the traditional neoclassical and Gothic styles of architecture, they stand in stark contrast to the rest of the monuments and structures existing around the state today. The pointed arches in the churches and government buildings for example, are completely different from the bulbous shaped domes which were an essential feature of buildings built during both Mughal and Nawab era.\\r\\nAs a tourist, it is not difficult to spot the colonial monuments in Uttar Pradesh, as part of your heritage tours. As with other styles of architecture which arrived to India from abroad and then fused with the traditional style of the region, the purely European design also blended with the Indo-Islamic style of architecture. In common parlance, this is also referred to as Indo-Saracenic architecture. You can observe this style of architecture in Uttar Pradesh in the churches, educational institutions (government schools and colleges), palaces, residential quarters and government buildings.\\r\\nIt should be remembered that the colonial era buildings in Uttar Pradesh are not limited to any particular region, city or town. They are distributed all over the state. For example, in Allahabad, the most popular colonial monuments are the Allahabad High Court and the University of Allahabad. Along with these structures, there also stands the All Saints Cathedral. Known in the local language as “Patthar Girjaghar”, it can be easily said that it is one of the most beautiful Anglican cathedrals in all of Asia. It was designed by Sir William Emerson in the 13th century in the Gothic style of architecture.\\r\\nOther colonial monuments which are great heritage tourist attractions in Uttar Pradesh are the Mayo Memorial Hall. Built in 1879 by R. Roskell Bayne in memory of the assassinated Viceroy Mayo, its main attraction is a 180 ft high tower. This hall was built with the purpose of hosting balls, receptions and public meetings.\\r\\nFrom Allahabad, the journey of exploring the most famous colonial monuments in Uttar Pradesh takes us to Varanasi. Here, the most popular of colonial era structures is the Sanskrit College. What makes this college special is the fact that it was one of the earliest colleges built by the British East India Company in India.\\r\\nLucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, famous for its culture (fondly referred to as “tehzeeb”), traditions and customs, is also home to several colonial monuments which were built under the British rule. One of these is the Raj Bhavan, which was earlier known as Kothi Hayat Baksh. It was designed by Major General Claude Martin and served as his residence. He chose Lucknow as his permanent place of residence because he was very impressed with its culture, mannerisms and traditions. Prior to independence, it served as the official residence of the Governor of United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. It came to be known as Raj Bhavan only after India’s independence. Another colonial era building in Lucknow which is fascinating to visit as a tourist is the Lucknow GPO, or the post office, as it is simply known. It is quite interesting to know that this same building was once a ring theatre visited by British families for purposes of fun and recreation. The screening of British dramas and films were a regular affair. How time changes, and with it, everything that it stands for! Thoughts like these engulf you as you explore the various colonial era buildings in Uttar Pradesh. Lucknow is also home to other colonial era buildings which were built during the colonial era like The Residency, Dilkusha Palace, La Martiniere School and Lalbagh Methodist Churches, among others. \\r\\nOne other place where you can visit the colonial era monuments during your heritage tour in Uttar Pradesh is Meerut. This place is famous for being the first center of uprising during the Indian Revolt of 1857. Some of the colonial era monuments which you can explore in Meerut are Begum Samru Church in Sardhana and Basilica of Our Lady of Graces. This church was built by Begum Samru and is one of the largest Roman Catholic Churches in North India. The design of the church is inspired by the St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and is constructed in pure white marble. It truly is a picture of tranquility and elegance.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nAll the colonial monuments which exist in UP today were built when it was under British rule. Undoubtedly, there is an overwhelming influence of European style of architecture, ie, neoclassicism and Gothic styles. That is evident by features such as the pointed vault and flying buttress.\\r\\nAs you explore the colonial monuments of UP, however, you should remember that they represent a combination of Indo-Islamic and European styles of architecture. This is a combination which one rarely comes across. For example, while the All Saints Cathedral is designed in the purely Gothic style of architecture, the Allahabad High Court and University of Allahabad are a combination of Indian and Western styles of architecture.  A structure like the Basilica of Our Lady of Graces displays an overwhelming influence of Italian with Indian styles of architecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother quite different sight awaits you at the district of Dilkusha in Lucknow. Here, the Dilkusha Palace, built by Nawab Saadat Ali Khan, derives its inspiration from an English country house called Seaton Delaval in Northumberland, which was built in 1721. Another Gothic style architecture is the Lalbagh English Methodist Church which is built in purely Gothic style of architecture.\\r\\nInteresting Facts\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the colonial era monuments in UP, particularly in Allahabad, are finest examples of European styles of architecture.\\r\\nA structure like the All Saints Cathedral is believed to be one of the finest Anglican cathedrals in Asia.\\r\\nThe Roman Catholic Church of Sardhana was honored by Pope John XXIII. It was he who accorded it the status of a minor Basilica in 1961.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntry Fee\\r\\nThe entry fee to the colonial monuments in UP depends on the monument you happen to be visiting. For visiting the Allahabad High Court require you to obtain a visitor’s pass, which is available at a nominal fee. Visiting the All Saints’ Cathedral does not require you to pay an entry fee. For visiting Dilkusha Kothi Palace, domestic tourists have to pay 5 INR, while international tourists have to pay 100 INR. For visiting churches, you don’t have to pay any entry fee, while visiting colonial monuments now serving as government offices will require you to do so.\\r\\nBest Time to Visit\\r\\nMost of the monuments built during the colonial era are located in the cities of Allahabad, Lucknow and Meerut. These cities tend to get quite hot during the summers, with temperatures averaging between 40°C to 43°C. If the heat doesn’t bother you much though, you can plan a trip to these colonial monuments in UP during the summers. In winters, though, the weather becomes cool and pleasant. It creates the perfect conditions for sightseeing and exploration, thus letting you have a great time. If you prefer cool weather, plan a trip during the winters.\\r\\nNearby Tourist Attractions\\r\\nMost of the colonial era monuments in UP are found in the cities of Allahabad, Lucknow and Meerut. All of them have played a part or been associated with the freedom movement in one way or the others. Besides colonial monuments, there are other places to visit in these cities.\\r\\nFor example, some of the tourist attractions located in close proximity to Allahabad High Court are:\\r\\n\\r\\nHanuman Mandir\\r\\nTriveni Sangam\\r\\nAllahabad Fort\\r\\nMayo Memorial Hall\\r\\nAnanda Bhavan\\r\\nAllahabad Museum\\r\\nKhusro Bagh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile you are in Lucknow, some of the places which you can visit after exploring Dilkusha Kothi Palace are:\\r\\n\\r\\nBara Imambara\\r\\nChowk\\r\\nHazratganj\\r\\nChota Imambara\\r\\nNawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-Rumi Darwaza Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rumi Darwaza (Gate) is an incredible structure which stands imposingly between Bara Imambara and Chota Imambara in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Constructed in 1784 under the rule of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, it is a fine example of Awadhi architecture, or the Lucknow School of Architecture. It was a style adopted by the Nawabs of Awadh to preserve the Mughal architectural style while experimenting with newer styles and materials.\\r\\nThe Rumi Darwaza, one of the heritage attractions in Uttar Pradesh, is also referred to as Turkish Gate because it bears a strong similarity in design to a gateway built in ancient Constantinople (today’s Turkey) called Bab-i-Humayun. Standing at an impressive height of 60ft, it once served as the entrance to Old Lucknow City. Today however, you find the gate looking on as auto rickshaws, bicycles and vehicles speed along underneath it. If you think this gateway looks beautiful during the daytime, wait till you see it illuminated during the evening when its beauty puts on a new face.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nThe Rumi Gate is an amazing piece of architecture, and is always included in any heritage tours. Standing at 60 ft, it has become the symbol of the city. While the Nawab School of Architecture seeks to preserve the Mughal architectural style, the materials used and the design itself vary in great degrees. For example, the majority of Mughal monuments were built using red sandstone, while bricks are the primary material used its construction along with a coating of lime. This is also one of the reasons behind the intricate detailing on this structure.\\r\\nOne of the most popular tourist attractions of India, Rumi Darwaza is adorned with wonderfully carved flowers and designs. The uppermost part of the structure is topped with a chhatri (umbrella) which can be reached through a staircase (although it’s not open to visitors at present). It is interesting to know that at one point of time, there was a lantern at the top of the structure. In addition, the exquisitely carved flower buds situated on the sides of the arch would release little jets of water. Now that would have been a sight to come across.\\r\\nEntry Fee\\r\\nRumi Darwaza is a gateway located on the road, hence, there are no entry fees to visit it. Anybody can visit it free of charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInteresting Facts\\r\\n\\r\\nRumi Darwaza is in no way related to the poet Rumi. It is so called because it was modelled after a similar gateway in Istanbul, which was then known as Constantinople under the Eastern Roman Empire.\\r\\nThe construction of this structure was started by the Nawab as part of the Food for Work programme at a time when this region was suffering from famine.\\r\\nGeorge Russell, who worked as a reporter for the New York Times in mid-19th century, called the stretch of road from Rumi Darwaza to Chattar Manzil as the most incredible landscape he had ever come across.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest Time to Visit\\r\\nRumi Darwaza can be visited anytime of the year.\\r\\nNearby Tourist Attractions\\r\\n\\r\\nChhota Imambara\\r\\nBara Imambara\\r\\nShahi Bauli Stepwell\\r\\nHazratganj\\r\\nBritish Residency\\r\\nNawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-Maharaja Bijli Pasi Quila Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\nMaharaja Bijli Pasi Quila is another historical landmark in Lucknow which is worth a visit.

Both these tombs, which are one of the popular tourist attractions in Lucknow, are known for their intricate architecture and the garden surrounding them.  Located in close proximity to the Begum Hazrat Mahal Park (built in 1962 to commemorate her contribution to the revolt of 1857), the tomb houses the 5th Nawab of Awadh, Saadat Ali Khan, and his wife, Khurshid Zadi. She was the favourite wife of the Nawab and died during his lifetime. Saadat Ali Khan was the ruler of Awadh from 1794-1814 AD, and many of the heritage buildings dotting the area between Qaisar Bagh and Dilkusha can be credited to him. During this time, the British ruled large parts of Lucknow and were becoming more powerful with each passing day. It is quite easy to overlook this wonderful memorial amidst other heritage buildings in the city like Chota Imambara and Bara Imambara. However, it is only upon visiting the tombs that you find out what you were missing out on. \\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nThe tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan and Khurshid Zadi are counted among the best places to visit in Lucknow. Their architecture has a lot to do with that. While its facade is decorated with lime plaster, the walls are built using Lakhuri bricks (red colored burnt clay bricks) while sandstone has been used for the floors. Upon entering the tomb, you come across rectangular verandahs with intricately carved arched doorways. Of these, those on the southern and eastern side contain the graves of the daughters and wives of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. The floor of the tomb has also been given an elegant look, thanks to the black and white marble tiles laid out in a chess like pattern. Among the other features of the tomb, its hemispherical dome deserves a special mention. It attracts the attention of the onlookers with its symmetrical shape and is topped by an inverted lotus and a finial. In the center of the hall, there is an elegant rectangular design which marks the exact place where the tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan rests. Head towards the basement and you come across three graves, one of the Nawab and the other two of his brothers. \\r\\nThe tomb of Khurshid Zadi is located to the east of the Nawab’s tomb. Although it is a four level structure, the graves of the mother and daughter rest at the lowest level. On the corners of the domes are octagonal shaped chhatris, which embellish its beauty. The tombs, which make for great sightseeing in Lucknow, are surrounded by beautiful gardens and are great for enjoying some moments of peace and solitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPopular Tourist Attractions Nearby\\r\\nApart from the tombs of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan and Khurshid Zadi, there are other tourist attractions in Lucknow which you should visit for having a great time.

Of these, the last stands out from the other due to the marked difference in the style of architecture. Vidhan Bhawan (state assembly), the seat of bicameral legislature in Uttar Pradesh, is one of the finest examples of Indo-European architecture with an overwhelming influence of Gothic elements. When viewed from a distance, this one of the top places to see in Lucknow looks akin to a palace. On national events like Independence Day and Republic Day, this historical site in Lucknow is bedecked with lights, and its beauty is enhanced manifold.\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nAllahabad, or what is today known as Prayagraj, was the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh till the early 20th century. In 1922, a decision was taken to shift the capital to Lucknow. It was on December 15, 1922 that the then Governor, Sir Spencer Harcourt Butler, laid the foundation stone of Vidhan Bhawan, then known as the Council House. The design of the building was conceived by two eminent architects of the time, Sir Swinton Jacob and Shri Heera Singh. The total expenditure of the building was estimated to be 21 lakh rupees, a tremendous amount of money at that time. It took about five years to complete its construction. The magnificence of the building perfectly reflects this exorbitant amount spent on its construction.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nIt can hardly be argued that the Vidhan Bhawan is an example of magnificent Indo-European architecture of the 20th century. The entire structure is two-storeyed and shaped in the form of a crescent. It was carved from light brown sandstone blocks brought from Mirzapur, which in local language is known as “Chunar”. An enormous Gothic styled dome is positioned in the middle of this palatial structure. The facade of the dome is adorned with various images carved from sandstone. These play a huge part in making it visually appealing. The portico of Vidhan Bhawan, one of the most beautiful tourist attractions in Lucknow, consists of three archways topped by the state emblem which is carved in marble. The roof is also as beautiful as the dome, as it is decorated with numerous figures of dancing peacocks. The entrance hall is also marked on both sides by circular marble staircases. The arches on the lower part of the structure do well to lend it utmost grace and style.\\r\\nPopular Tourist Attractions Nearby\\r\\nApart from the Vidhan Sabha, there are other popular tourist attractions in Lucknow which provide excellent options for sightseeing and exploration.

According to popular legend, Ramchandra of Ayodhya, the hero of the Ramayana, gifted the territory of Lucknow to his devoted brother Lakshman after he had conquered Sri Lanka and completed his term of exile in the jungle. Therefore, people say that the original name of Lucknow was Lakshmanpur, popularly known as Lakhanpur or Lachmanpur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city of Ayodhya itself, forty miles away from Lakshmanpur, was reported to be full of great riches: \"Its streets, well arranged, were refreshed with ceaseless streams of water ~ its walls, variously ornamented, resembled the checkered surface of a chess-board. It was filled with merchants, dramatists, elephants, horses and chariots. The cloud of fragrant incense darkened the sun at noonday: but the glowing radiance of the resplendent diamonds and jewels that adorned the persons of the ladies relieved the gloom!\" (Ramayana). \\r\\nThe ancient metropolis of Ayodhya was situated on the banks of the Ghagra, a river as wide as the Ganges at Chunar and its extensive ruins can still be seen. There is no record of when and how Ayodhya came to be deserted or allowed to decay: the legend is that Rama ascended to heaven, carrying with him all the population of the place. So large had the city been that Lakshmanpur was described as its suburb!\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking a descent through the mists of time we alight upon Ayodhya again in the record books of the Emperor Akbar. It is a prodigious descent in time -from fifteen centuries before the Christian era to fifteen centuries after. Incredibly though, not much is known about the history of Avadh during this time. We know that after the conquest of Kanauj by the Afghans at the. end of the twelfth century, Avadh submitted to the Sultan of Ghazni, and so became part of the empire of Delhi. Avadh then asserted its independence for a while under a Muslim ruler, but he was over- thrown by Babur, and Avadh became a subah or province of the Moghul empire. \\r\\nAs the Moghul power declined and the emperors lost their paramountacy and they became first the puppets and then the prisoners of their feudatories, so Avadh grew stronger and more independent. Its capital city was Faizabad.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the Muslim states and dependencies of the Moghul empire, Avadh had the newest royal family. They were descended from a Persian adventurer called Sadat Khan, originally from Khurasan in Persia. There were many Khurasanis in the service of the Moghuls, mostly soldiers, and if successful, they could hope for rich rewards. Sadat Khan proved to be amongst the most successful of this group. In 1732, he was made governor of the province of Avadh. His original title was Nazim, which means Governor, but soon he was made Nawab. In 1740, the Nawab was called Wazir or vizier, which means Chief Minister, and thereafter he was known as the Nawab Wazir. In practice, from Sadat Khan onwards, the titles had been hereditary, though in theory they were in the gift of the Moghul emperor, to whom allegiance was paid. A nazar, or token tribute, was sent each year to Delhi, and members of the imperial family were treated with great deference: two of them actually lived in Lucknow after 1819 and were treated with great courtesy. \\r\\n\\r\\nAchieving a certain degree of independence from the Moghuls in Delhi did not, unfortunately, mean that the Nawabs could rule entirely as they pleased. They had merely exchanged one master for another. The British, in the form of the East India Company based in Calcutta, had long looked with predatory eyes at the wealth of Avadh. Excuses for interference in the province were not hard to find. The most catastrophic from the Avadh point of view came when Shuja-ud-Daula invaded Bengal, and actually briefly held Calcutta. But British military victories at Plassey in 1757 and Buxar in 1764 utterly routed the Nawab. When peace was made, Avadh had lost much land. But the enemies became friends, on the surface anyway, and the Nawab Wazir was extolled in the British Parliament as the Chief native allay of the East India Company in all India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nawabs surrendered their independence little by little over many years. To pay for the protection of British forces and assistance in war, Avadh gave up first the fort of Chunar, then the districts of Benares and Ghazipur , then the fort at Allahabad; all the time the cash subsidy which the Nawab paid to the Company grew and grew. \\r\\nIn 1773, the fatal step was taken by the Nawab of accepting a British Resident at Lucknow and surrendering to the Company all control over foreign policy. Soon the Resident, however much he might defer ceremonially to the Nawab, became the real ruler.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsaf -ud-Daula, son of Shuja-ud- Daula, moved the capital from Faizabad to Lucknow in 1775 and made it one of the most prosperous and glittering cities in all India. Why did he move? On a whim, it is said, because he wanted to get away from the control of a dominant mother. On such a thread did the fate of the great city of Lucknow depend!\\r\\n\\r\\nNawab Asaf-ud-Daula was a generous and sympathetic ruler, an inveterate builder of monuments and a discriminate patron of the arts. He built the Bara Imambara with its intricate bhul-bhulayya and adjoining mosque, primarily to create employment for his subjects during a time of drought. The Rumi Darwaza also testifies to his architectural zeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis son, Wazir Ali, was the one who most regretted his grandfather\\'s acceptance of a British resident at Lucknow. In 1798, the Governor-General removed him from the throne, on the excuse that there was doubt as to whether he was a true son of Asaf-ud- Daula, but more probably because he was displaying tendencies to independence. They put Asafs brother, Sadat Ali Khan, on the throne. Sadat Ali Khan, though economical in fiscal management, was nevertheless an enthusiastic builder and commissioned many grand palaces, including Dilkusha, Hayat Baksh and Farhat Baksh, as well as the famous Lal Baradari. Hereafter the dynasty had to look to Calcutta rather than to Delhi to settle the succession.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assassination of a British Resident in 1798 in Benares by the deposed Wazir Ali gave further excuse for interference, and Lord Wellesley (brother of the Duke of Wellington) was just the man to exploit it. By the treaty of 1801, the Nawab had to give up his own army, and pay heavily for a British-led one in its place. The southern doab (Rohilkhand) was ceded, and the remainder of the district of Allahabad and other areas became part of British India. In thirty years, Avadh had lost half its territory to the British.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nawab demanded in return for these concessions that he should have a free hand in governing his remaining territory, unchecked by the advice or interference of the British. But in this, he was badly handicapped by the fact that he had to rely on British troops to enforce his orders. Wellesley had another trick up his sleeve: a clause of the treaty by which the Nawab under- took to establish a system of administration \"by the advice of and acting in conformity to the counsel of the officers of the Honourable Company\" which should be conducive to the prosperity of his subjects. It seemed a harmless clause but was to be the means by which the British eventually annexed Avadh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, from 1819 onwards, things ran their course in Avadh. Sadat Ali being gathered to his fathers, Ghazi his son, sat on the musnud, the throne, and took the cognomen \"ud-Din\", implying Defender of the Faith. He was formally invested with the title of King by the British, though ironically the proclamation of kingship coincided with a period of almost complete dependence on the British. He lent two million of rupees to the British feringhee for the Nepal War, and at its close got the Nepalese Terai ~ a marshy forest extending along the foot of the Himalayas -in liquidation of half the debt. Some might have thought it a poor bargain, but in fact the Terai eventually produced some unbelievably valuable timber.\\r\\n\\r\\nGhazi-ud-Din was a good monarch, responsible for much building and public works of all kinds, and he paid due attention to the administration of justice. He built the Mubarak Manzil and Shah Manzil as well as Hazari Bagh, in which he introduced Lucknow society to the sport of animal contests for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, his son Nasir -ud-Din who succeeded to the throne, had an attachment to the English, not founded upon those things the English would like to be admired for -justice, liberty, democracy -but upon their dress, their eating habits and, more unfortunately, the drinking -habits of the more disreputable element of English adventurer with whom he surrounded himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nNasir -ud-Din, despite such a temperament, was a popular monarch, who was responsible for the construction of an astrological centre, Tarunvali Kothi. Equipped with sophisticated instruments, it was entrusted to the care of a British astronomer. When he died there was another disputed succession and the British insisted on Muhammed Ali, another son of Sadat Ali, being enthroned. Muhammed Ali was a just and popular ruler and under him, Lucknow regained its splendor for a brief spell. He was however sorely troubled by rheumatism. He died in 1842 and his son Arnjad Ali succeeded, a man more inclined towards matters religious and spiritual, leading to the neglect of governance. He was succeeded by Wajid Ali Shah, poet, singer, avid patron of the arts and lover of Lucknow. Of him it was written, \"He is entirely taken up in the pursuit of his personal gratifications. He has no desire to be thought to take any interest whatever in public affairs and is altogether regardless of the duties and responsibilities of his high office. He lives exclusively in the society of fiddlers, eunuchs and women: he has done so since his childhood and is likely to do so till his last.\" (\\'The Private Life of an Eastern King\\' by William Knighton.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis portrait of Wajid Ali Shah was used to justify British annexation of Avadh. If the charges of mismanagement levied against Wajid Ali Shah were true, the British were as much responsible for this as the Nawab. They were more in control of the administration and finances of Avadh since the 1780\\'s than the Nawab. In addition, Avadh had been impoverished by the incessant cash demands of the British on the Nawab. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe excuse at last came for the British to invoke that clause of the 1801 Treaty. And the Governor General in 1856, Lord Dalhousie, was just the man to do it. Avadh was annexed, Wajid Ali Shah shipped off to virtual imprisonment in Matiyaburj in Calcutta and, though this was not on the British program, the stage set for the greatest rebellion to date against their power in India.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Wajid Ali Shah\\'s wives, the Begum Hazrat Mahal, remained in Lucknow, and when the Mutiny came in 1857, she put herself at the head of those fighting for freedom. The Begum never did surrender, she died in Nepal in 1879.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Traditional accounts and legends ascribe the origin of Lucknow to Lord Rama's favourite brother, Lakshmana who is believed to have founded the settlement and named it Lakshamanavati or Lakshmanpur after himself. It was venerated as a sacred place associated with the worship of Sheshnaga, the Lord of the nether regions.\\nArchaeological Excavation in Lucknow: The archaeological excavations at the Hulaskhere mound, located on the banks of the Karela Lake in Mohanlalganj tahsil, near Lucknow, link the city to pre and proto-historic times. The six-metre-high massive mound covers an area of 80 acres and dates from prehistoric times to the Sunga-Kushan era, and from the imperial Guptas (first century B.C. to A.D.400) to the Delhi Sultanate. The finds include a hoard of silver coins belonging to the period of Vinayak Pal Deva of Kannauj (tenth century AD), which were unearthed by the priest of the Kalleshwari Devi temple, situated near the excavation site. The excavations are believed to have yielded the remains of a civilization which dates back to 1000 B.C. according to Dr. Rakesh Kumar Tiwari, Director of the State Department of Archaeology, Lucknow. The remains belong to a prosperous agricultural community which had well-structured buildings and a developed civic system. The ancient remains include terracotta gamesmen and figurines, beads, shell beads and ivory bangles. The remains indicate an active socio-cultural milieu during the pre-Buddhist period, i.e. before the fifth century BC. The archaeological remains also testify to the domestication of animals as part of the economic infrastructure. Meat appeared to be a staple food as is evident from bones found in the excavation. The remains of buildings indicate the use of concrete structures, belonging to the beginning of A.D.400. The brick walls of the houses, which comprised of two to three rooms with sloping roofs, were exposed. Lanes and by-lanes between two housing complexes formed part of the town plan. A 20-metre-long road across the lake has also been encountered which seemed to connect two settlements on either side of the lake.\\nLucknow in Kushana Period: The Kushana levels (c. 100 BC to A.D.100), which yielded punch-marked silver coins and copper and gold-coated glass beads, reflect the prosperity of the inhabitants. The terracotta human figurines sporting beards and moustaches may be compared with the Kushana stone sculptures unearthed and stored in the Mathura Museum. Another interesting find includes a stamped gold commemorative inscription bearing the image of a popular deity Kartikeya, wearing a head-dress with three jewels, and holding a spear. The figurine bears testimony to the contact of the Hulaskhera Township, with places outside. The historic phase (A.D.40-900) provides evidence of large rooms being converted into smaller units. Even the teracotta figurines indicate a marked decline in the plastic arts. But the evidence of a brick fort is notable for the remains of large housing complex, which may have been a community centre or a nobleman's residence.\\nLucknow during 16 Mahajanapadas Era: During the early historic period, Lucknow and its neighborhood formed part of the once-celebrated Kosala Mahajanapada. In the accounts of the Brahmanas and the Jataka, Kosala existed as a territory in the time of King Janaka of Mithila.\\nLucknow in Maurayan and Kushana Empire: This region was later included in the Mauryan and Kushana Empire. Kushana antiquities including sculptures, large-sized bricks, teracotta and a coin were recovered from the neighborhood of Lucknow. There are no direct references to Lucknow in historical narratives, nor any archaeological finds which may help in reconstructing the ancient past.\\nLucknow in post-Pratihara Period: The most striking incident in the post-Pratihara period was the invasion of Saiyid Salar Masud Ghazi, the nephew of Mahmud of Ghazni. He is reported to have tried to reduce the territory of Awadh to submission between A.D. 1031 and 1033 and died in action at Bahraich where he is buried. In the fourteenth century, Lucknow came under the rule of the Sultans of Delhi, and thus began a new phase of its history as a part of the Delhi Sultanate.\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To know more about Lucknow history, read further the information given below.\\nAfter 1350 AD the Lucknow and parts of Awadh region have been under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, the Nawabs of Awadh, the East India Company and the British Raj. Lucknow has been one of the major centers of First War of Independence, participated actively in India\\'s Independence movement, and after Independence has emerged as an important city of North India.\\nUntil 1719, subah of Awadh was a province of the Mughal Empire administered by a Governor appointed by the Emperor. Saadat Khan also called Burhan-ul-Mulk a Persian adventurer was appointed the Nazim of Awadh in 1722 and he established his court in Faizabad near Lucknow.\\nAwadh was known as the granary of India and was important strategically for the control of the Doab, the fertile plain between the Ganga and the Yamuna rivers. It was a wealthy kingdom, able to maintain its independence against threats from the Marathas, the British and the Afghans. The third Nawab, Shuja-ud-Daula fell out with the British after aiding Mir Qasim, the fugitive Nawab of Bengal. He was comprehensively defeated in the Battle of Buxar by the East India Company, after which he was forced to pay heavy penalties and cede parts of his territory. The British appointed a resident in 1773, and over time gained control of more territory and authority in the state. They were disinclined to capture Awadh outright, because that would bring them face to face with the Marathas and the remnants of the Mughal Empire.\\nLucknow\\'s rise to growth and fame begins with its elevation as capital of Awadh by Nawab Asaf-Ud-Dowlah. He was a great philanthropist and gave Lucknow a unique and enduring legacy. The architectural contributions of these Awadh rulers include several imposing monuments. Of the monuments standing today, the Bara Imambara, the Chhota Imambara, and the Roomi Darwaza are notable examples. One of the more lasting contributions by the Nawabs is the syncretic composite culture that has come to be known as the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb.\\nIn 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan alienated both his people and the British, and was forced to abdicate. The British then helped Saadat Ali Khan to the throne. Saadat Ali Khan was a puppet king, who in the treaty of 1801 ceded half of Awadh to the British East India Company and also agreed to disband his troops in favor of a hugely expensive, British-run army. This treaty effectively made the state of Awadh a vassal to the British East India Company, though it notionally continued to be part of the Mughal Empire in name until 1819.\\nThe treaty of 1801 formed an arrangement that was very beneficial to the Company. They were able to use Awadh\\'s vast treasuries, repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. In addition, the revenues from running Awadh\\'s armed forces brought them useful revenues while it acted as a buffer state. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with pomp and show but with little influence over matters of state. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the British had grown impatient with the arrangement and wanted direct control of Awadh.\\nIn 1856 the East India Company first moved its troops to the border, then annexed the state, which was placed under a chief commissioner - Sir Henry Lawrence. Wajid Ali Shah, the then Nawab, was imprisoned, and then exiled by the Company to Calcutta. In the subsequent Revolt of 1857 his 14-year old son Birjis Qadr son of Begum Hazrat Mahal was crowned ruler, and Sir Henry Lawrence killed in the hostilities. Following the rebellion\\'s defeat, Begum Hazrat Mahal and other rebel leaders obtained asylum in Nepal.\\nThose company troops who were recruited from the state, along with some of the nobility of the state, were major players in the events of 1857. The rebels took control of Awadh, and it took the British 18 months to reconquer the region, months which included the famous Siege of Lucknow. Oudh was placed back under a chief commissioner, and was governed as a British province. In 1877 the offices of lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces and chief commissioner of Oudh were combined in the same person; and in 1902, when the new name of United Provinces of Agra and Oudh was introduced, the title of chief commissioner was dropped, though Oudh still retained some marks of its former independence.\\nThe province of Awadh (anglicized to Oudh) was annexed by the East India Company in 1856 and placed under the control of a chief commissioner. In the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (also known as the First War of Indian Independence and the Indian Mutiny), the garrison based at the Residency in Lucknow was besieged by rebel forces. The famous Siege of Lucknow was relieved first by forces under the command of Sir Henry Havelock and Sir James Outram, followed by a stronger force under Sir Colin Campbell. Today, the ruins of the Residency, and the picturesque Shaheed Smarak offer reminiscences of Lucknow\\'s role in the stirring events of 1857.\\nThe city played an important role in both the First War of Independence and the modern Indian freedom struggle. Whether it was the Lucknow Pact of 1916 or the Khilafat Movement, it brought the citizens on a united platform against the British rule. In the Khilafat Movement Maulana Abdul Bari of Firangi Mahal, Lucknow actively participated and cooperated with Mahatama Gandhi and Maulana Mohammad Ali.\\nIn 1901, after staying the capital of Oudh, since 1775, Lucknow, with a population of 264,049, was merged in the newly formed United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.[7] However, it became the provincial capital in 1920 when the seat of government was moved from Allahabad. Upon Indian independence in 1947, Lucknow became the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the erstwhile United Provinces.\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The history of Lucknow can be traced back to the ancient times of the Suryavanshi Dynasty. It is said that Lakshmana, who was the brother of Lord Rama, laid the foundation of the ancient city. This was near the Gomti River on an elevated piece of land. It was then called Lakshmanpur. However, the city came into notice only during the 18th Century. To know more about Lucknow history, read further the information given below.\\n\\nIt was during the year 1720 when the great Mughal emperors began to appoint Nawabs in order to ensure smooth administration in the province. In the year 1732, Mohammad Amir Saadat Khan was appointed as the viceroyal of Awadh, in which Lucknow was a major province. It was then that the powerful dynasty of the Nawabs, which changed the history of this unknown place. Under the rule of the Nawabs, Lucknow flourished like never before. After 1755, Lucknow grew by leaps and bounds under the rule of the fourth Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula. Lucknow flourished in each and every aspect, which includes poetry, dance, music and the other finer aspects of the lifestyle of Lucknow.\\n\\nIt was when the British came to India that Lucknow was made into an administrative capital. There were many uprisings during the British rule by Indian radicals and many ghastly incidents left Lucknow with bad memories. However, after independence Lucknow was declared the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh by the Government of India. Since then it has progressed beautifully, merging skillfully the past with the present.\\n\\nThe name of Lucknow city can be traced back to the epic ‘Ramayana’. When Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya, after 14 years of exile he gifted this place to his younger brother Lakshman, who is believed to have stayed in Lakshman Teela, a high ground on the banks of the river Gomti. Later, the region was named after his as ‘Lakshmanpur’. There are other stories that do the rounds; Lucknow was named after a very influential person called ‘Lakhan Ahir’ who built the fort ‘Qila Lakhan’. The name ‘Qila Lakhan’ later became Lucknow. Some other sources says that one Lakhu Khan, earlier a non-Muslim having the name Laxan Singh, had lent his name to Lucknow.\\n\\nThe city has archaeological remains dating back to 3000 BC but Lucknow’s foundations were laid in the 13th century A.D. Lakshman Teela, the central part of the city, is believed to have been the site where a fort was built by a clan from Bijnor. By the end of the 13th century, the fort had fallen into the hands of the Sharqi rulers of Jaunpur, who held it till 1476. In the 1540s, the fort was annexed by the Sultan of Delhi, Sher Shah Suri (reigned 1540-45).\\n\\nThe architectural contributions of the Awadh rulers include numerous mosques and palaces (many paintings of these are now maintained at the Art Gallery). Of the monuments standing today, the ‘Bara Imambara’, the ‘Chhota Imambara’ and the Roomi Darwaza’ are notable examples.\\n\\nAwadh was annexed by the proclamation of 14 February 1856 and the king (Nawab Wajid Ali Shah) was deported to Calcutta, where he died on 21 September 1887. As per the old settlement records of 1862,  2/3rd of Bhadruka village was part of the cantonment area. From the gazette Vol. XXXVII of 1922 (the district Gazetteers of the United Provinces of Agra and Awadh), it is gathered that the ruinous building in Dilkusha Garden was known as Dilkusha Palace, which was built by Sadat Ali Khan as a hunting box and country residence, around which he laid out an extensive park and stocked it with deer and other games. After the first war of independence, the building was occupied by the General Officer Commanding Awadh District. To the south of the ruins, there are few graves of officers and men who fell during the capture of Lucknow. It was at this place, Sir Henry Havelock died on 24 November 1857. In the gazetteer referred to above, it is also stated that Lucknow Cantonment was the Headquarters of Awadh Military District.\\n\\nHistorically, cantonments were places where the army of colonial government had to be exclusively quartered in an effort to keep the armed forces totally insulated from the ruled. Cantonments meant quarters assigned for lodging troops, a permanent military station created by the British government in India for the location of military formation away from the civilian towns and insulated from the Indian nationalist influences. Housing was the core objective. Subsequently, housing itself attracted the civil population to reside in the cantonments and the economic spin-offs attracted other activities. The bazaar area was recognized and the anatomy of the cantonment got clearly defined with military, the bungalow and civil areas clearly defined. The cantonments as local self-government organizations have always remained a puzzle. The civilian population wants to be in it but is uncertain about their status and their future.\\n\\nDue to repeated demand for reforms by the representatives of cantonment population, the Cantonments Act, 1924 was enacted to introduce local self-government in the cantonments, which contained substantial civil population. The Act was the first model municipal Act for cantonments, but in its implementation, decentralization and democratic norms were largely compromised because of the status of the citizen who occupied the property only as a licensee of the Government.\\n\\nIn 2006 the Cantonments Act, 1924 was replaced by the Cantonment Act, 2006 with a view to impart greater democratization and improve the financial base of cantonments to make provision for developmental activities, etc. Presently there are 62 Cantonments in the country distributed among five Army Commands. The cantonments are categorized as Category I, Category II, Category III and Category IV on the basis of the civil population. As per the latest Census, Lucknow cantonment area falls under Category I, with a population above 50,000.\\n\\n\\nVibrant and cosmopolitan Lucknow earned fame as the seat of the Nawabs of Awadh in 18th century. Its history and heritage, however, goes back much further. The city is believed to have been founded by Lakshman, the younger brother of Lord Ram, who gave his name to it. As Lucknow grew it came under the rule of various kingdoms including the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals. The city finally came into its own in the 18th and 19th centuries as the capital of the Nawabs of Awadh, who were feudatories of Mughals. They lavished such attention on it that it came to be known as the “Golden City” and “Constantinople of the East”. The disintegration of the Mughal Empire made Awadh a kingdom in its own right.\\n\\nThe rise of the East India Company in India ushered in a new era which saw the fall of Awadh and the state being annexed to British India in 1856. The last Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled to Kolkatta. The next year, Lucknow emerged as one of the main centres of the Revolt of 1857. In the fierce fighting that ensued much of the historic city was battered. The British regained control of Luknow and it later became the capital of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. Lucknow continued to play an important role and after independence was named capital of the new state of Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\n\\nLucknow is one of the most beautiful and strikingly original cities of India, formerly, known as Lakshmanpur a Hindu city founded in prehistoric days by Lakshman, the brother of Rama King of Ayodhya, with the advent of Sheikhs and Pathans left behind by the receding army of Mahmud Ghazni, a new colony came into existence and altered the name intoLUCKNOW and after the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Moghul Empire, which was already tottering as a result of bigotry and lack of sympathy and foresight on the part of Aurangzeb who was surrounded by hordes of enemies his intolerance has created passed into the hands of his weak minded and successors.The end was not far off, when Nadir Shah, the Persian invader, hastened it by sacking Delhi and carrying off the famous Peacock Throne.\\n\\nThe rapid growth of Lucknow dates from 1775 when Asaf-ud-daula, the wazier Nawab of Oudh removed the capital from Faizabad to Lucknow and Ghazi-ud-din Haider was the first Nawab wazier who was raised by Lord Hasting to the dignity of King of Oudh in 1819 and promoted to the rank of the Imperial city of Nawabs.\\n\\nThe kingdom of Oudh had been under British administration since 1857, when the last king Wajid Ali Shah was deposed by Lord dalhousie, and a storm of Mutiny swept over the city of Nawabs, after which it was added to the British administration and many sweeping changes effected the style of the city. Markets were built for the general convenience, buildings were constructed and Lucknow was declared the Capital of the United Provinces.\\n\\nRiver Gomti and Ghazi-ud-din Haider canal both are running through the heart of the city.The southern portion of the canal being dry and is not so useful but the river is very useful and adds a special item to the grandeur of the city.\\n\\nLucknow, which is the residence of the Governor of U.P. has a first class garrison.

Besides these Lucknow has the honor of having the Colvin Taluqdar School, Merris College of Hindustani Music, Technical and Art and Craft Schools\\n\\nLucknow was the home of Urdu language which was famous for its charm and lucidity but now the national language Hindi has taken it's place. Lucknow is famous for Chiken Embroidery work.\\n\\n\\nArchaeological findings related to Lucknow testify to the fact that Lucknow is a pretty ancient city, but the city in its present form was set up by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula in the year 1775. The foundations of this aristocratic city touted as the mecca of Urdu language and the seat of refined elegance and aristocratic sophistication, the history of Lucknow is not so ancient compared to the other Indian cities.\\n\\nNawab Asaf-ud-Daula belonged to the Awadh dynasty and he was instrumental in the inflow of a number of gifted artists and thinkers from Persia who brought with them the Shia tradition.\\n\\nLucknow was considered to be favorable place for the pursuit of art and culture. The later Awadh rulers became debauch and the incompetent and this was used as an excuse for the British to take over Lucknow.Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula is a prominent name in Lucknow's history. It was at his initiative that the process of modernizing Lucknow was set in motion. He commissioned the construction of a number of magnificent monuments that serve as the popular tourist draws of Agra. It was due to his financial backing that work was resumed in the Bada Imambara.\\n\\nAfter spending enjoyable and unforgettable moments in Lucknow, the city of Nawabs, most often travelers like to engage their time in Lucknow excursions. There are myriad interesting places around Lucknow that act as a major pull on the travelers and compel them to cross the periphery of the city and see what lies ahead.\\n\\nOn cutting across the boundaries of the city, the first place that beckons travelers to savor its charm is Faizabad. It is located 124 km from Lucknow. Some of the very interesting places to visit here include Fort Calcutta and mausoleum of Bahu Begum and Gulab Bari.\\n\\nBut if you are looking for the most preferred destinations among other tourists on excursions from Lucknow then Kanpur and Ayodhya are unbeatable. Kanpur is located at a distance of 77 kms from Lucknow. It is a flourishing industrial city of Uttar Pradesh. It was the first city to witness the establishment of one of the first cotton mills of the country. Besides, this city abounds in several historical monuments of great interest.\\n\\nAfter visiting Kanpur on excursions around Lucknow you can also go for the very famous Ayodhya city. This city enjoys a significant place in the history of the mythological era of Lord Ram who was the king of Ayodhya. This holy city is around 135 km from Lucknow. It abounds in numerous temples and every year a whopping number of devotees throng here.\\n\\n\\n\\nLucknow is the capital city of the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is known for its rich history, cultural heritage, and delicious cuisine. Lucknow was once the seat of power of the Nawabs of Awadh and was a center for art, music, and poetry. \\n\\nOne of the most famous landmarks in Lucknow is the Bara Imambara, a large complex of buildings that includes a mosque, a tomb, and a labyrinth known as the Bhulbhulaiya. The Chota Imambara is another prominent structure in the city, which is known for its intricate architecture and beautiful chandeliers.\\n\\nLucknow is also famous for its mouth-watering cuisine, which includes a variety of kebabs, biryanis, and other meat dishes.

The bustling markets of Hazratganj, Aminabad, and Chowk are popular shopping destinations for tourists.\\n\\nLucknow is well connected by air, rail, and road to major cities in India. The Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Lucknow is the second busiest airport in Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\n\\nLucknow is the capital city of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and has a rich and vibrant history that dates back to the ancient times. The city has been ruled by various dynasties and empires throughout its history, each of which has left its mark on the city.\\n\\nLucknow was initially founded by the Suryavanshi dynasty, which ruled the region during the ancient times. The city was known as Lakshmanavati during this time, in reference to Lord Lakshman, the younger brother of Lord Rama from the Hindu epic, Ramayana.\\n\\nIn the 16th century, Lucknow came under the rule of the Mughal Empire and became a center of art, culture, and learning. During this time, the city became famous for its elaborate Mughal gardens, palaces, and architecture, such as the Bara Imambara and Chhota Imambara.\\n\\nIn the 18th century, Lucknow became the capital of the Awadh region, which was ruled by the Nawabs of Awadh. This was a golden period for Lucknow, as it became a hub of arts, literature, music, and cuisine. The Nawabs of Awadh were known for their love of luxury and patronage of the arts, and this led to the development of a unique Lucknowi culture.\\n\\nDuring the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Lucknow became a center of resistance against British rule. The British captured the city after a long siege, and it became the capital of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.\\n\\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, Lucknow became the capital of the newly created state of Uttar Pradesh. Today, Lucknow is a thriving city that combines its rich history and cultural heritage with modernity and progress.\\n\\n\\nHistory of Lucknow starts around 1350 AD, when this place was known as Awadh. Lucknow presently is the capital city of Uttar Pradesh and one of the heritage cities in India. Historically, located in Awadh region, Lucknow has always been a multicultural city. Courtly manners, attractive gardens, poetry, music, and fine cuisine patronized by the Persian-loving Shia Nawabs of the city are popular amongst Indians and admirers of South Asian culture and history. Lucknow is popularly known as the City of Nawabs. It is also known as the Golden City of the East, Shiraz-i-Hind and The Constantinople of India.\\n\\nThe ancient history of Lucknow mentions that after 1350 AD the Lucknow and parts of Awadh region have been under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, the Nawabs of Awadh, the East India Company and the British Raj. Lucknow was one of the major centers of First War of Independence and participated actively in India's Independence movement, and after Independence has emerged as a prime city of North India. Until 1719, subah of Awadh was a province of the Mughal Empire that was administered by a Governor selected by the Emperor. Saadat Khan also called Burhan-ul-Mulk a Persian adventurer was chosen as the Nazim of Awadh in 1722 and he established his court in Faizabad near Lucknow.\\n\\nThe region of Awadh was known as the granary of India and was important advantageously for the control of the Doab, the rich plain between the Ganga and the Yamuna rivers. It was an affluent kingdom, able to maintain its independence against pressure from the Marathas, the British and the Afghans. The third Nawab, Shuja-ud-Daula fell out with the British after associating with Mir Qasim, the deserter Nawab of Bengal. He was finally defeated in the Battle of Buxar by the East India Company, after which he was forced to pay heavy penalties and surrender certain parts of his territory. The British selected a resident in 1773, and over the span of time gained control of more territory and authority in the state. They were reluctant to capture Awadh completely, because that would bring them in direct conflict with the Marathas and the remnants of the Mughal Empire.\\n\\nHistory of Lucknow states the rise to growth and fame of the city with its elevation as capital of Awadh by Nawab Asaf-Ud-Dowlah. He was a great philanthropist and gave Lucknow a exceptional and enduring heritage. The architectural contributions of these Awadh rulers include several impressive monuments. Of the monuments standing today, the Bara Imambara, the Chhota Imambara, and the Roomi Darwaza are distinguished examples. One of the long-lasting contributions by the Nawabs is the composite culture that has come to be known as the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb.\\n\\nThe medieval history of Lucknow, in 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan estranged both his people and the British, and was forced to hand over. The British then helped Saadat Ali Khan to achieve the throne. Saadat Ali Khan in the treaty of 1801 ceded half of Awadh to the British East India Company and also agreed to disperse his troops in favor of a hugely expensive, British-run army. This treaty successfully made the state of Awadh a vassal to the British East India Company, though it theoretically continued to be a vital part of the Mughal Empire in name until 1819.\\n\\nThe treaty of 1801 was important in the history of Lucknow and formed an arrangement that was very beneficial to the Company. They were able to use Awadh's vast treasuries, constantly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with lavish lifestyle but with little influence over matters of state. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the British had grown intolerant with the arrangement and wanted direct control of Awadh. In 1856 the East India Company first moved its troops to the border, then annexed the state, which was placed under a chief commissioner - Sir Henry Lawrence.\\n\\nThe province of Awadh was annexed by the East India Company in 1856 and placed under the control of a chief commissioner. In the Indian Rebellion of 1857, rebel forces besieged the garrison based at the Residency in Lucknow. The famous Siege of Lucknow was relieved first by forces after the decree of Sir Henry Havelock and Sir James Outram, followed by a stronger force under Sir Colin Campbell. Today, the ruins of the Residency, and the picturesque Shaheed Smarak offer reminiscences of Lucknow's role in the exciting events of 1857.\\n\\nThe history of Lucknow has special mentioning in both the First War of Independence and the modern Indian freedom struggle. Whether it was the Lucknow Pact of 1916 or the Khilafat Movement it brought the Indian citizens on a united platform against the British rule. The history of Lucknow also includes the Khilafat Movement Maulana Abdul Bari of Firangi Mahal, where Lucknow actively participated and cooperated with Mahatama Gandhi and Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar, Freedom fighter and one of the greatest parliamentarians, Firoj Gandhi was also related to this city.\\n\\nThe modern history of Lucknow started in 1901, when after staying the capital of Oudh, since 1775, Lucknow, with a population of 264,049, was merged in the newly formed United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. However, Lucknow became the provincial capital in 1920 when the seat of government shifted from Allahabad. Upon Indian independence in 1947, Lucknow became the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the previous United Provinces.\\n\\n\\n\\nLucknow, a name famous for its history, culture, people, cuisine and many others, has indeed an intriguing origin. The history of this ancient city is not only fascinating to the historians, but also to the common man. This city has been known for its mouth-watering Mughal delicacies as well as the ancient eminent heritage sites. The city, therefore, attracts plenty of tourists throughout the year. Above all, the holy temples located in various parts of the city are no less in drawing a huge gathering on the auspicious days and during festivals. Overall, this is indeed a beautiful city and worth a visit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom 1394 to 1478 that is for 84 years Awadh had been a section of Sharqi Sultanate of Jaunpur. It was around 1555 that Humayun had converted Awadh as a part of Mughal Empire.\\n\\nTill 1719, Awadh was a province under the Mughal Empire and administered by an Emperor appointed Governor. During 1720, the Nawabs were appointed by the great Mughal Emperors to ensure a better functioning of the province.  It was in 1722, a new viceroy of Awadh, officially known as the Nizam of Awadh, was appointed named Mohammad Amir Saadat Khan, a Persian adventurer. He later set up his court in Faizabad. This marked the beginning of the flourishing Lucknow during the strong dynasty of Nawabs. Lucknow, building a new history, was like never before.\\n\\nAwadh was well known as an agricultural storehouse of India. It was a wealthy kingdom, protecting itself from the foreign threats of British, Afghans and the Marathas. Shuja-Ud-Daula, the third Nawab, was defeated by the British in the Battle of Buxar. Following this, he was pressurized to pay huge chunk of penalties and give up parts of his territory.\\n\\nLucknow started developing after 1755 under the tenet of the fourth Nawab named Asaf-ud-Daula, a great philanthropist. Lucknow created a name for itself in various different spheres including poetry, music, dance and other aspects of Lifestyle. The Awadh rulers contributed heavily on the architecture of the city. They were enthusiastic enough to raise some of the imposing monuments such as the Bara Imambara, the Rumi Darwaza, the Chota Imambara and other such notable ones.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1773 the British appointed a resident and gradually acquired control of more authority in the state. However, the British were reluctant to capture Awadh straightaway so as to avoid the threat from remaining Mughal Empire and the Marathas.\\n\\nThe fifth Nawab of Lucknow, Wazir Ali Khan, in 1798 isolated his people and British, and was required to surrender. The British helped the fourth Nawab to the throne and made him a puppet king.\\nIn the treaty of 1801, Saadat Ali Khan was forced to cede out half of the province of Awadh to the British and agreed to release his troops in favour of the pricey British run army. The British Raj had utilized the province’s vast treasuries by exploiting them for loans at low rate. The Nawabs were made only the ceremonial kings all with all the grandeur, but with little or no influence over administration of the state. It was by the mid of 19th century that British had claimed a direct control of Awadh. Awadh continued to be a division of the Mughal Empire till 1819.\\n\\nIn 1856, the British moved its troops and imprisoned the then Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah. In the revolt of 1857, his 14 year old son Birjis Qadar was crowned the ruler. Sir Henry Lawrence was killed in the conflict.\\n\\nIn the first war of Indian Independence and Indian Mutiny, also known as the Indian rebellion in 1857, the rebels took direct control of Awadh. It took almost 18 months for the British to re conquer Awadh, the period known as the popular Siege of Lucknow. The rebel forces were successful in besieging the regiment based at the Lucknow residency. Under the commandment of Sir James Outram and Sir Henry Havelock, the blockade was relieved. One can recollect the Lucknow’s role in the dramatic incidents of 1857 through the impressive Shaheed Smarak and the remnants of the Residency.\\n\\nThe Khilafat Movement had been active against the British rule. This movement had created a united platform where Firangi Mahal’s Maulana Abdul Bari had taken an active participation and cooperated with Maulana Mohammad Ali and Mahatma Gandhi. Lucknow had remained the capital of Awadh since 1775, and it was only in 1901 that this city, with a headcount of 264,049, was integrated with the newly established United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. When the administrative head was moved from Allahabad in the year 1920, Lucknow transformed into the provincial capital.  Lucknow was declared as the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the former United Provinces, upon the epoch-making Indian Independence in the year 1947.\\n\\nIt is true that Lucknow underwent several bad phases during the rule of the Western country. The uprisings by the different rulers and plenty of appalling incidents left the city in a ruined state of memories. However, since Independence there has been no looking back for this famous city. These historic remains have urged ample of visitors from all over the world. The city has developed to great heights in various spheres.\\n\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Private hospitals like Apollomedics and Medanta have cutting-edge facilities and skilled medical staff, while government hospitals like SGPGIMS and KGMU are renowned for their super-specialty services. Although there are differences in the experiences that patients have in different facilities, Lucknow's healthcare system is nonetheless thriving and meets a wide range of medical needs. People are urged to do their homework and get recommendations from reliable sources before selecting a hospital to locate the one that would best meet their needs.\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Edited excerpts:\\n\\nSustainable townships have become essential for fostering a greener and more ecofriendly urban environment. Can you elaborate on the key principles and strategies adopted by the Lucknow Development Authority to create sustainable townships within the city?\\n\\nThe process of development of the following self-sufficient (Sustainable) townships is in progress on the basis of the importance of eco-friendly environment and green belt as per the standards set by Industry Sustainable Practices under Lucknow Development Area.\\n\\n(a) We have proposed to develop a world class Institutional Area in Education CityMohan Road scheme. Due to the availability of all the facilities related to education at one place, the scheme can be made sustainable. To balance the environment a Central Park along with extensive tree plantation is being proposed in the scheme. Plot development will also be done for housing in the scheme.\\n\\n(b) Health care related facilities such as Medical Health Centre, Medical Medicine City wholesale and retail trade and storage of medicines, Ayurvedic Medical Centre, Yoga and Vipassana Centre etc. are to be developed in the Wellness CitySultanpur Road scheme. Residential and group housing plots will also be developed for the residences of persons related to these facilities to create and promote a balanced Live-Work scenario.\\n\\n(c) With a view to encourage nonpolluted industrial business activities in the plan, along with industrial plots, residential plots have been planned in IT-City Sultanpur Road. Social and physical infrastructure such as commercial areas, hospitals have been planned to support the Township. The main focus of the scheme is to provide maximum employment to the aspirants while promoting industrial business.\\n\\nSmart cities are often associated with leveraging technology to enhance urban living. What role does technology play in the development and management of smart cities in Lucknow?\\n\\nLucknow Development Authority has also made the development sustainable, cost effective and time saving and more efficient on the basis of Leveraging Technology. Under the works of Smart City, works of smart components have been adapted and are proposed on various roads and intersections in the city. Place making has been done in and near various public spaces.\\n\\nClean urban transport is crucial for reducing pollution and congestion in growing cities. What initiatives has the Lucknow Development Authority undertaken to promote clean and sustainable transportation options?\\n\\n\\nIn the field of transportation, the Lucknow Development Authority is undertaking the construction of a 4-lane green corridor of 28.00km length from IIM road to Kisan Path. The total cost of the project is Rs 7700.00 crore. 6.00km in length in the first phase construction of 4-lane road from IIM to Pakka pul and bridge at Gaughat in progress.The Corridor will provide a smooth movement as well as lessen the distance within the city.\\n\\nAffordable housing is a significant concern in many urban areas. How does the Lucknow Development Authority address this issue, and what steps are being taken to ensure that residents from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds can access quality and affordable housing within the city?\\n\\nAffordable Housing for such people of Lucknow city, whose family does not have a permanent house, 4512 (G + 3) buildings are being constructed under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban). The covered area of each building is as per PMAY guidelines. Earlier in Sharda Nagar and Basant Kunj Yojana, 4512 houses of this category were completed and allotted to the public and given possession. About 600 families have also started living in these buildings.\\n\\nWith rapid urbanisation, cities often face challenges in balancing development with environmental conservation. How does the Lucknow Development Authority strike a balance between urban growth and environmental preservation, particularly in the context of infrastructure projects and expansion?\\n\\nThere are various projects in the works to achieve Environmental and Ecological planning. Last year, 1.26 lakh saplings were planted by the Authority in the field of environmental protection and balance and this year also 1.25 lakh saplings are to be planted during the rainy season. The work of promotion/ conservation of various lakes (Such as Yamuna Jheel, Kala Pahad Lake, and Butler Palace Lake etc.) Is being done by the Lucknow Development Authority. The development work of wetland in a 37 acres area is in progress in CG City Yojana to preserve the natural state of it, so that the environmental balance is maintained with the infrastructure. On top of that there are several parks such as Fragrance Park, Amrit Vatika, Happiness Park, Miyawaki Forest at CG city, UP Darshan Park etc. are also in the development to create a healthy urban environment.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

According to another version, its original narne was Lakshmanavati ('fortunate' in Sanskrit). The city is located in the heartland of Awadh, the fertile plain between the Ganga and the Yamuna rivers, geographically known as the Doab. During the 18th-century Mughal rulers appointed Nawabs to ensure efficient and smooth administration of the region. In 1732, Mohammad Amir Saadat Khan was appointed as the viceroy of Awadh. Thence arose a powerful dynasty of the Nawabs, which transformed the Awadh region for good. In 1775 Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab moved the capital from nearby Faizabad to Lucknow.

Born on March 11, 1950, Shiv Murti is one of the leading voices in contemporary Hindi fiction. Hailing from humble background, his life was full of struggle. But the best steel is made when iron is passed in hottest temperature. This holds true for author Shiv Murti. A person of few words, he let his works do the talking for him. His first story ‘Mujhe Jeena Hai’ followed by ‘Paanphool’ was published when he was studying in 12th standard. Thereafter he never looked back. His works depict the plight of rural folk in true light. Caste politics, power politics, poverty and Dalit problems form the theme of his works. One of his best novels ‘Triyacharitra’ portrays the life of a young girl who is false implicated for having an illicit relationship and as a consequence has to bear the brutal punishment handed out by gram panchayat. This novel was later made into a movie by Basu Chatterjee. Since his works paint a picture of rural life in true fervor, his fans consider him as second Premchand. But he brushes aside this compliment saying: “Premchand is Premchand. I can never replace him.” His other novels are Trishul and Tarpan. Keshar Kasturi is a collection of stories authored by him. Now his fans should gear up for the re- release of his novel ‘Akhiri Chhalang’. Shivmurti has won Kathakram and Hans award in the past. Though he is satisfied with the kind of Hindi works produced today, he expresses concern at the youngsters losing interest in Hindi literature.\\n\\nThe Pride of Lucknow award for excellence in women empowerment was bestowed on Madhvi Kuckreja, a social worker and founder of NGO Vanaangan. Humbled to receive the award, she considers herself fortunate to have won it though she had shifted her base to Lucknow only few years back. She has set up a shop, Sanatkada here that sells handicrafts, functions as a café, a book club and a film club, all rolled into one. Madhvi has supported numerous women-led, grassroots-level organizations to emerge as transparent, vibrant entities that are sensitive to women. Internationally, she has worked on building opinion against women being subjected to violence in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka and Sudan. Before moving to Lucknow, she was earlier working in Bundelkhand for alleviating the problems of Dalit women, who are entangled in triad of poverty, caste discrimination and gender subjugation. Though they have been financially independent for long, Dalit women are subjected to discrimination and violence in all forms manifesting itself through rape, public humiliation, or honor killings. Another common punishment for breaking community rules that is also used simply for vengeance is public stripping and parading of women. Violence can also take an extreme form with lynching of women labeled as witches or dayans. Domestic violence however, cuts through religious, caste and class boundaries-dowry related death caused by “accidental” burning of women thrives in the state. Moreover, when women gain property rights-usually after being widowed-they become targets of violence by members of the family or community. Therefore, instead of being economically empowering, property is itself a reason for violence against women. She expresses satisfaction that Due to the collective efforts of her NGO, knowledge levels among Dalit women have increased and they are assuming leadership roles in the village community.\\n\\nThe third Pride of Lucknow award was conferred on noted Urdu author Anees Ashfaq. His work ‘Dukhyare’ highlighting his close relationship with elder brother carries the undertones of declining affluent culture of Lucknow. Elated though to receive the award, he considers ‘Qalam’ as his biggest award. “My writings are useless until they fail to strike a chord with genuine readers,” he said on his felicitation. So what make him pursue writing in Urdu? “I was an avid reader at the age of 18-19. Credit goes to my mother for imparting me lessons in Urdu and shaping my language as it is today.” He expresses concern at the declining habit of reading in today’s youngsters and their overriding ambitions to become stars overnight. He, however, lauds the initiative of Lucknow Society and stresses such rendezvous should be encouraged as they serve as a platform to bring genuine writers together and instills awareness among people. His writings reflect genuine critical analysis of the contemporary scenario. He believes that writings on Lucknow today are not portraying it in true light. With his desire for cultural revival of the city, his upcoming next novel is also set in Lucknow.\\n\\nWith conferring of these four awards, honouring of the dignitaries at the festival came to an end. We at Lucknow Society are thrilled to award best of talent in the city and will continue to reward blossoming excellence in the years to come.\\n\\n\\n\\nTEAM (2017):\\n\\nOur Patron:\\nDr. Aziz Qureshi\\nEx.

Edited excerpts.\\n\\nAs the Managing Director, what challenges have you faced in the expansion and operation of the Lucknow Metro? How did you address these challenges, and what lessons did you learn from them?\\n\\nUtility identification proved to be a challenge in the expansion and operation of the Lucknow Metro. The whole city had already been used for public facilities like roads and buildings. The older part of the city had a lot of water underground, which made it hard to build things below the ground. The streets in those areas were really crowded, and controlling the traffic became a big problem. Finding substitute ways for the traffic movement had been tough. So, to address these issues, the Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) team had to widen some footpaths, remove electrical poles, cables, and also shift some water pipelines and sewer lines. With efficient management, it was ensured that the public did not face any trouble. To ensure smooth traffic movement along with the safety of commuters, most of the heavy structural erection work was carried out at night till the wee hours. The UPMRC team literally worked day and night to ensure maximum comfort for the people of Lucknow.\\n\\nI would say our biggest achievement was the people’s support. As citizens, it’s not easy to move around with such heavy construction work going on for such a long period of time. However, UPMRC made all possible efforts to minimise people’s diversions and troubles while they passed through the Metro construction sites. We even planned diversions and roadblocks in a phased manner, which ensured that people always had an alternate route nearby with ample manpower on the roads directing people towards the diversions. UPMRC also communicated about the diversions in advance to the media for wide circulation of such information. It is because of these measures that people showered us with full support and immense trust in our work. A huge factor in our success is the people’s support.\\n\\nThe most remarkable achievement was the erection of curved U-girders near the IT intersection for the first time by the Lucknow Metro Project team. The erection of I-girders near the polytechnic intersection was also difficult due to traffic congestion in the area. The major challenges, like the erection of a 225 m long balanced cantilever span at Mawaiya railway crossing with operational Indian railway lines beneath, the erection of a 60 m special steel span at Awadh rotary, a 177 m long balanced cantilever bridge on the Gomti river, and another 60 m special steel span at Nishatganj (constructed in just 5 days), were overcome by strategic planning and careful execution by the dedicated team of engineers.\\n\\nAnother major challenge was to construct an underground tunnel in Hazratganj where we not only had to dig a tunnel beneath the centuries-old buildings but also keep the heritage and cultural beauty intact. Convincing the shop owners was another challenge, who felt their shops would collapse. After due convincing and strategic planning, we delivered what we promised. The beautiful metro stations have added to the majestic charm of the Hazratganj Market, blending in so seamlessly like they were always there.\\n\\nThe construction of the underground metro station around Haidar Canal also attracted lots of challenges from the people residing in slum areas around it. As a suitable solution, over 60 families were relocated to a different place for the period of construction and were also compensated.\\n\\n\\nMy experience says with the right balance of expertise, strategy, planning, and skills, one can move mountains. You need to have foresight and plan ahead to be able to see the possible challenges and work your way around them.\\n\\nLucknow Metro has been praised for its focus on sustainability and eco-friendly initiatives. Could you elaborate on some of the eco- friendly measures the corporation has undertaken, and how do you balance environmental concerns with meeting the transportation needs of the city?\\n\\nUPMRC ensured that the city’s green cover remained intact, and more green practices were adopted during the construction phase. Approximately 410 trees were transplanted (pulled along with the roots and relocated elsewhere), and the route map’s design was altered at specific locations to preserve over 500 trees. UPMRC also took steps towards waste reduction and the use of renewable resources.\\n\\nTo maintain the cleanliness of the city’s roads, a wheel washing plant was installed at construction sites. Every loading-unloading vehicle leaving the construction site was required to pass through the wheel washing plant. Only after the dirt-packed wheels were washed and cleansed of construction mud, the vehicles were allowed to move onto the city roads from the construction site.\\n\\nLucknow Metro has installed a total of 1.032 MW of solar panels across the Transport Nagar Metro Depot and Administrative Building. Additionally, 2 MW of solar panels on the roofs of metro stations are planned and expected to be implemented soon. This initiative will result in saving lakhs on electricity bills, which are charged at commercial rates.\\n\\nUttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.\\n\\nIn addition to these solar initiatives, Lucknow Metro has implemented several energy conservation measures. These include the use of regenerative braking in trains, resulting in a saving of 30 to 35 percent of traction energy. Recently, UPMRC also participated in the Energy Exchange Program, becoming the second Metro in India to do so. This has resulted in saving around Rs 10 lakhs worth of energy per month.\\n\\nThe Lucknow Metro in India is a pioneer in using 100% LED lights on its trains and stations. They also use special roof sheets to let in natural light and panels to reduce heat and improve ventilation. This shows their commitment to being eco- friendly.\\n\\nThey’ve also come up with a smart way to save energy on escalators. After 3 minutes of no use, the escalators slow down, and after 6 minutes, they stop completely. This saves a lot of energy, around 2.32 lakh KWh.\\n\\nAt night, they only use specific lights for maintenance on the tracks, which saves about 0.43 lakh KWh of energy every year.\\n\\nLucknow Metro has contributed significantly to the city’s public transportation system. How do you see the role of the Metro evolving in the broader urban development and transportation planning of Lucknow?\\n\\nMetro projects constitute the foundation for facilitating urbanisation, ensuring economic development, and heralding the social transformation of the city. The metro services interconnect the major nodes of the city, reducing commuting time while enhancing connectivity. They also alleviate congestion by decreasing vehicular traffic on the roads and addressing the issue of encroachment. Through the reduction of fuel costs, it has emerged as a cost-effective and sustainable mobility solution.\\n\\nThe enhancement of transportation and infrastructure acts as a catalyst for economic development by attracting multinational firms, creating direct and induced employment opportunities, enhancing tourism prospects, and transforming the city into an industrial, commercial, and business hub. Metro projects also have a ripple effect on ancillary industries such as real estate and manufacturing firms, among others.\\n\\nThe Lucknow Metro has set a benchmark among other metros across the country with the successful implementation of the Mass Rapid Transit system (MRTS). The people of Lucknow are already utilising the Metro in large numbers, especially in congested areas like Charbagh, Singar Nagar, Krishna Nagar, Munshipulia, Hazratganj, etc. A significant advantage of our Metro is its connectivity to the Airport, Railway Station, and Bus Stand, including CCS Airport, Charbagh Railway Station, Alambagh Bus Stand, along with the ‘CCS Airport to Munshipulia’ stretch, facilitating seamless inter-state mobility.\\n\\nThis has significantly improved connectivity and surpasses road transport in terms of decongestion, reduced travel time, and cost. Upon becoming operational, Phase 1-B of the East-West corridor will further enhance connectivity by encompassing densely populated areas in old Lucknow.\\n\\nSafety is a critical aspect of any transportation system. How does Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation prioritise and ensure the safety of passengers and staff? What measures are in place to address emergency situations and prevent accidents?\\n\\nThe Lucknow Metro is undoubtedly the safest mode of public transport with a robust surveillance and security system. Various measures and systems that are in place for safe commuting and a secure working environment include:\\nEach cab (coach) is equipped with two Passenger Emergency Intercoms (PEIs) for direct communication with the Train Operator in case of emergencies or threats. The CCTV footage from the PEI-equipped coach is automatically transmitted to the Cab, OCC, DCC, and Security Control room.\\nThere are 24 CCTV cameras per train to monitor activities both inside and outside the train at all times. The feed is displayed in the Driver Cab, Centralised OCC, and Security Control room.\\nThere are 50 to 60 CCTV cameras per station for continuous monitoring.\\nSecurity checks are conducted regularly.\\nThere is a presence of female security personnel at all stations.\\nThere is a presence of female housekeeping staff inside/near women’s washrooms.\\nGlass-panelled see-through offices are provided for station controllers, and ticket counters ensure continuous station monitoring.\\nThe station areas are properly illuminated, with no dark spots.\\nMetro projects require extensive collaboration with various stakeholders, including the government, private contractors, and the public. How do you manage these relationships and ensure smooth coordination to ensure the project’s success?\\n\\nAny organisation executing a metro rail project works in close coordination with various government departments. Starting from acquiring the land and obtaining clearances from the Development and Forest Departments, making changes in the design and layout of the project for better connectivity with other transport terminals, securing clearances from the Fire Department and working with organisations focused on assisting individuals with disabilities to gather input for designing stations to facilitate passengers with special needs, among other aspects. Regular meetings and follow-ups are conducted to ensure the smooth execution of the project. Similarly, the media is also kept updated about the progress of every project to ensure that the public is well-informed about ongoing developments, which in turn helps generate trust and cooperation during both the project and operation phases.\\n\\nLucknow Metro\\n\\nThe working process with contractors is also completely streamlined, with timely approvals and payment processing being ensured to keep the team motivated and focused. What I am trying to convey is that it’s a two-way street. We adopt a highly proactive approach when it comes to keeping our stakeholders informed and involved at every step, and this approach pays dividends. Government departments tend to place significant trust in our work, and as a result, in situations where roadblocks arise, we receive support from the authorities to keep the project moving forward.\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, the role of contractors is extremely vital in ensuring the success of our projects. It’s a mutually beneficial professional relationship where we treat our teams like family. For instance, during the second wave of Covid, many civil projects across the country came to a standstill. However, at UPMRC, we not only resumed work after obtaining approvals from the government but also managed to complete the Kanpur Metro Project ahead of the December 2021 deadline. This achievement was made possible due to the Labour colony that UPMRC established to accommodate construction workers near the project site itself. UPMRC provided them with transportation, housing, and medical facilities, in addition to arranging temporary shelters and meals for the labourers. The UPMRC team took great care to maintain hygienic conditions within the premises and on the field to prevent the transmission of Covid.\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Lakshman equalling Lucknow. Though the period between 1500 BC and 1500 AD is foggy historically, the city re-emerges in written accounts as a province in the Mughal empire.\\n\\nAs oft happens with waning realms, the appointed governors started taking over the Mughal provinces when the empire started losing its supremacy in the sub-continent. Lucknow fell in the hands of Awadh’s Nizam: Saadat Khan, from Khurasan, Persia, in 1722. Fifty-three years later, the city by the banks of the River Gomti became the capital of the Awadh Nawabs when Asaf-ud-Daula, the 4th Nawab, shifted his seat of administration from Faizabad to it. His rationale: He wanted to get away from his mother!\\n\\nAnd thus, started one of India’s cultural epochs, in which the arts reached unbridled heights in creativity and scale. Though political allegiance shifted from the Mughals to the British East India Company in the ensuing years, art, music, dance and architecture flourished under the Nawabs. They transformed Lucknow into a fairy-tale land straight out of the Arabian Nights.\\n\\nBut Lucknow, as a city, was way too strategic in its location for the Company. Not satisfied with just allegiance, they removed the Nawabs from power in 1856.\\nIf you have the time, and the inclination, this self-guided walk may just make you fall in love with the city, many times over. A day-long saunter, a coffee break at the only café in the vicinity, and thousands of photo-ops which really do no justice to the real thing, and you have one of travel’s most perfect memories.\\nThe walk starts at the north end of the Hardinge Bridge, a deck-arch 103-year-old road bridge built over the Gomti River and still very much in use. Also known as Laal Pul or Pakka Pul, it replaced an earlier stone bridge. It was inaugurated on 10 January, 1914 by Lord Hardinge, then Viceroy of India.\\n\\nHaving crossed the bridge, the snow-white Teele Wali Mosque and Tomb of Shaikh Pir Muhammed stand to your right. The oldest in the precinct, they were the last set of monuments built by the Mughals. Teele Wali Mosque, literally meaning “Mosque on the Mound,” was once part of a vibrant Islamic theological school with nearly 700 students at a time. The British razed the complex to the ground in response to the 1857 uprising but let the mosque stand. Its exquisitely painted halls are the site of a Sunni ritual held uninterrupted for the past 350 years—the Alvida Namaz [last Friday prayer of Ramzan].\\n\\nThe dome-topped Tomb of Shaikh Pir Muhammed (1674) next to it is dedicated to an Islamic saint who came to Lucknow when the city was still under the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb’s rule. Make a wish. It just might come true.\\nOnce back on the main road keep to your right. Ahead of you is the Asafi Imambara to your left. But before you enter it, do stop and take a look at the magnificent edifice decorated with pairs of twirling fishes bang opposite, on the right—the Naubatkhana or Naqqarkhana or Drum House. A distinctive Mughal form of architecture, it once housed drummers and an orchestra to announce the hours of the day and royal comings and goings.\\n\\nFactoid: The fish, a cultural element unique to Lucknow and Awadh, has its roots in “Maahi-Maratib,” a Mughal military honour with Persian roots. It was bestowed on kings and commanders, and took the form of a fierce-looking fish’s head mounted on a staff behind the recipient during war. So how did one fish turn into a pair in Lucknow? According to legend, two fish leaped into Lucknow’s first Nawab, Saadat Khan’s lap when he was crossing the River Ganga on his way to Faizabad. Considered a double dose of good fortune, it stayed on as a typical element of Awadhi art and architecture.\\nThe Bara Imambara ensemble is without a doubt Lucknow’s magnum opus. Grand, elegant, with sweeping lines and charming details, it comprises of an outer and inner gateway, the Shahi Baoli, Asafi Masjid, and the most famous of all, the Bara Imambara itself with its tantalising Bhool Bhulaiya.\\n\\nWith a mainly Shi’a population since Saadat Khan’s time [he was Persian], the Imambara is a functioning shrine for Azadari, a commemorative event which defines Shia’s communal identity. Azadari is the mourning and lamentation rituals associated with Muharram, the remembrance of the martyrdom of Hussain, grandson of Prophet Muhammad, at Karbala in 680 AD.\\n\\nOnce past the two gateways, to your left is the formerly five-storeyed Shahi Baoli (1784). Now part of it buried under water, it started off as a water reservoir for the ongoing constructions at the complex. It was later turned into an exotic guesthouse with fountains, inlaid marble floors, and hot and cold water—the Shahi Mehmaankhana, as well as used as living quarters by members of the royal family. If you look into the waters at a specific point, you can catch the reflections of those at its entrance.\\nBuilt by Asaf-ud-Daula in 1784, the monuments in the Bara Imambara complex were made with Lakhanui bricks and lime plaster sans any wood or iron, half a million Rupees, and 20,000 workers over 14 years. The reason?\\n\\nThe brainchild of the 4th Nawab, it was conceived as a means to create employment for his subjects when strife and penury struck his state because of a terrible famine. The labourers piled up bricks all day, and the aristocrats pulled the edifice down every night, enabling everyone to stay employed for as long as was needed.\\n\\nDesigned by Hafiz Kifayat ullah from Mughal Delhi, the star of the complex is the Bara Imambara. Its central hall, 164 feet long and 49 feet high, is the largest vaulted chamber in the world. There is not a single pillar inside it; the roof is supported only by interlocking bricks. Asaf-ud-Daula lies buried in its centre.\\n\\nBut most visitors go in to get lost in the maze on its upper floors, the Bhool Bhulaiya, an architectural strategy to avoid excess weight on the ceiling. A lot is said of the need for a guide inside its convoluted passageways which eventually open onto the roof with spectacular views. May I suggest you do not take one.\\n\\nJust keep climbing whatever steps you find to be going up. And half the joy is anyways of getting lost. Coming down is trickier where there is a specific number that need to be climbed down, and then up, and then down again with many of the corridors ending in dead ends or an unguarded window opening into the looming hall below. In this instance, for survival’s sake, ask for help.\\nBack on the main road, carry on further down Husanabad Road. You will pass the long gone Musafirkhana on the left, of which only the main gateway now remains. The rest of the edifice was demolished in 1857.\\n\\nStraddling the main road right in front of you is Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula’s other masterpiece—the stunning Rumi Darwaza—Lucknow’s pride and the city’s icon. Sixty-feet-high, it was built in 1784 – 86, and marked the entrance to the Old City. It is said to be identical to an ancient gateway in Constantinople, Turkey. Filled with intricate detailed carvings, the front and back are different in design.\\n\\nFurther down Husanabad Road, past Rumi Darwaza, is the heritage precinct’s second architectural ensemble to your right, all now painted red. The first to come your way is the 221-feet-high Clock Tower with a 14-feet long pendulum and a 12-petal flower-shaped dial. It was built in 1882 – 87 by the Hussainabad Endowment Trust to mark the arrival of the first Lieutenant Governor of the United Province of Awadh, Sir George Couper to Lucknow.\\n\\nFacing it is the handiwork of Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah (1837 – 42), 4th King of Awadh. There’s the Lal Baradari built in 1838; now called the Hussainabad Picture Gallery lined with life-size portraits of the Nawabs of Awadh. In front of it is Hussainabad Talab with a small mosque and hammam at its corners. Behind the two is Satkhanda, an incomplete watchtower reminiscent of the Tower of Babel. Only four storeys high, construction had to be abandoned following the Nawab’s death.\\n\\nFactoid: First simply called “Nawabs,” the Awadh rulers were given the added title of “King” by the British from Saadat Ali Khan (1798 – 1814) onwards. Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah was the 9th Nawab, but referred to as the 4th King.\\nOften considered to be more beautiful than the Bara Imambara complex, the Chota Imambara group of monuments stands at the tail end of Husanabad Road, past the Hussainabad Gateway. Smaller and more intimate, the poetic white edifices around the crystal-clear pond are filled with intricate carvings and exquisite calligraphy. They were all built by Muhammad Ali Shah.\\n\\nThe most important of all is the gold-domed Chota Imambara with its black and white calligraphy on the outer walls. It contains the King and his mother’s tombs, and is a venue, like its larger counterpart, for Muharram mournings. Two miniature Taj Mahals flank this centrepiece. One contains the tomb of his daughter, Zinat Aliya, whilst the other is a Jawab, built solely to maintain symmetry and lies empty. Interestingly, the one with the tomb is more staid and plain; the empty one more exuberant in its decoration. A white carved mosque completes the grouping.\\n\\nDo take the time to wander inside the Chota Imambara and marvel at its collection of Belgian chandeliers and gilt-edged mirrors. Whilst at it, also don’t miss the painting, which I am told by one of the clerics, contains the entire Koran in a super-micro font point size.\\nAt the main crossing ahead take the left road which leads to Daulatganj. A couple of hundred yards away to your left, behind a tangle of trees, perched on a rocky outcrop is Jama Masjid, the ending point of the walk.\\n\\nConstruction on Jama Masjid started during the reign of Muhammad Ali Shah as soon as he came into power, with the intention to surpass Delhi’s Jama Masjid in both beauty and grandeur. Unfortunately, he died before he could see his ambitions through. One of his wives, Malika Jahan Begum, completed the mosque in 1845; albeit to a much smaller, less majestic version of the original plan. Mughal in style with Hindu and Jain carvings, the functioning mosque with people praying, women chatting, and children playing is one of the loveliest I have been to.\\n\\nAnd with this, we come to the end of the walk, a wee bit in love with the city of Nawabs called Lucknow.\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Nothing comes as close to telling what Lucknow has been and is all about, as the Lucknow Mahotsav.\\n \\nLucknow Mahotsav is a 10-day long cultural extravaganza held annually in the month of November or December. It showcases the rich cultural heritage of Lucknow through various performances including classical music and dance, ghazals, qawwalis, and traditional folk performances. The festival also features exhibitions, food stalls, and craft displays. Lucknow Mahotsav is organized every year to showcase Uttar Pradesh Art and Culture and in particular Lucknavi \\'Tehzeeb\\' so as to promote Tourism. One of the objectives of the cultural bonanza is to provide encouragement to the Artisans. Craftsmen from all over the country bring their masterpieces to the festival to the delight of shoppers. Colorful processions, traditional dramas, Kathak dances in the style of Lucknow Gharana, Sarangi and sitar recitals, ghazals, qawalis and thumri produce a cheerful atmosphere during the ten-day-long festival. Exciting events like ekka races, kite flying, cockfighting and other customary village games re-establish an ambience of the bygone Nawabi days.\\n\\nLUCKNOW MAHOTSAV TELLS THE TALE OF LUCKNOW\\'S VIBRANT PAST:\\nNothing comes as close to telling what Lucknow has been and is all about, as the Lucknow Mahotsav. A kaleidoscope of craft, couture, culture and cuisine, the 10-day mega fair is a cornucopia of colours and cheers in all forms. It literally transports the visitor to the old world charm of the City of Nawabs, as much as to its modern-day delights. Let us, as proud Lucknowites, take you on a trip down memory lane to trace the origin, past, present and possibly the future of this pageant.\\nIt is instructive to recall, that the year 1975 was observed as the Tourism Year and since then, every year, Lucknow Mahotsav has been organized. Even back then, the carnival held a charm and a vibe that was unmatched by others.\\nSince its humble beginnings, it has become one of the grandest events, not only for Lucknowites welcoming the winters but for thousands of people across the country, many, who use this opportunity to showcase their craft. For us Lucknowites, the Mahotsav marks 10 (or so) days of riveting fun, excitement, a time to reflect on the past and everything that Lucknow is today.\\n\\n\\nBRINGING HINTS OF NOSTALGIA AMID LAKHNAWIS:\\nJust the words \"Lucknow Mahotsav\\'\\' evoke nostalgia and fond remembrance in die-hard Lakhnawis. Mahotsav evenings are remembered by many as gatherings of people from all walks of life, who come to take in the arts of Lucknow, to enjoy the rich Awadhi cuisine, which is symbolic of Lucknow and to catch a fleeting essence of the nawabi culture in the form of Kavi Sammelans, Mushairas and the likes.\\nIn the recent past, Lucknow Mahotsav\\'s festivities have been taken to the next level as national performers and artists have come here to elevate and illuminate Lucknow\\'s forgotten arts and more. These artists come here not only to rekindle the flame of these forgotten arts but to achieve and obtain new heights, to find new meaning within them.\\n\\n\\nMAHOTSAV BRINGS FORTH FORGOTTEN AWADHI ARTS:\\nArtisans who are skilled at the centuries-old Zardari, Chikankari and associated works come here to show their wares. Chikankari is one of Lucknow\\'s most lucrative arts and for good reason. It requires skill, precision and years of training, and the artisans of Lucknow have got it down to a T. Textile art is part of a traditional lifestyle and subtly blends with new-age fashion. When at the Mahotsav, you have to indulge in the simple yet elegant work of chikan artists.\\nAnd then there\\'s the delectable Lucknowi cuisine. Since Lucknow Mahotsav is a celebration of the city\\'s past, there\\'s no way anyone can miss out on the food. Exotic foods and rich cuisines have always been a part of Lucknow\\'s culture, and the Mahotsav delivers. Here, you can get everything from Tunday ke Kebab to Wahid ki Biryani and then some more. Lucknow is nothing short of a foodie\\'s paradise and in the many years of the Mahotsav, we\\'ve learned that we, Lucknow locals, are suckers for our own food.\\nOver the years, Lucknow Mahotsav has expanded its wings to make way for artists, craftsmen and artisans from areas in Uttar Pradesh and the country but the essence of Lucknow, and its charm is not forgotten for a moment. This is perhaps best quantified in the hordes of Lucknowites who come for the Mahotsav from all parts of the city.\\n\\n\\nMAHOTSAV HOLDS A SPECIAL PLACE FOR LUCKNOWITES:\\nIt simply goes to show that Lucknowites are curious about their own city and are always looking to find something new around a corner in Lucknow. The Lucknow Mahotsav brings together the galis of Chowk, the swank localities of Gomti Nagar and everything in between. A city within a city, the Mahotsav has been beckoning us since we were children and has not only shaped what the city is today but also the people. The Mahotsav is a place of discovery and serendipity, a place where time stands still and the past is celebrated, making way for the future to come. At the conclusion of each Mahotsav, Lucknowites walk tall and proud, even as they await with eager anticipation for the next version.\\n \\nHISTORY: \\nThe year 1975-76 was observed and organized in South Asia as The Tourism Year. On this occasion in the motive to promote Lucknow\\'s Art, Culture and Tourism for national and international tourists, the decision to organize the Lucknow Festival was taken. During this period with exception to a few years, Lucknow Mahotsav has been organized every year. Lucknow Mahotsav evening would be adorned with on one hand by the celebrities, famous artists\\' performances and on the other by renounced classical singers. In this program the upcoming local artists have been provided a special representation on the cultural evenings. In addition, the national as well as local Poets/ Shayars have been provided due representation through Kavi Sammelan and Mushayara.\\n\\nCUISINES:\\nMahotsav is a delight for the connoisseurs of good food as it is the ideal place to pamper the taste buds of the visitors with endless varieties of scrumptious dishes as a wide range of cuisines are available at the festival, including Kesaria Doodh, Kabab-parathas and other mouth-watering non-vegetarian exotic dishes.\\n\\nENTERTAINMENT:\\nThe 10 days long festival is one such example. The festival invites many musical as well as comical artists for completing your day in its full sense. The festival celebrated between 25 November and 5 December in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, is a cultural extravaganza. During these 10 days, the entire arena is filled with people enjoying various rides and other poetry/cultural events.\\n\\n\\nAddress: \\nKanshiram Smriti Upwan, Jalvayu Vihar, Ashiyana, Jalvayu Vihar, Lucknow - 226001\\n\\nBusiness Information:\\nLucknow Mahotsav Sthal in Jalvayu Vihar, Lucknow Lucknow Mahotsav Sthal in Lucknow is one of the leading businesses in the Fair Grounds.

The weekend promises to be the ultimate celebration of the King of Fruits, in a multitude of gastronomic avatars, through Saturday and Sunday – holding pride of place for the Saturday Stories and being the centerpiece of delicacies as we celebrate the Father’s Day Brunch on 18 June 2017.\\n\\nIn order to procure the best of mangoes the state offers, the Ramada Lucknow team travelled to Malihabad, which along with Kakori and Mal form the Mango Belt of Uttar Pradesh. The destination was the mango orchards of Bhupendra Singh, popularly known as “Raja Sahab Mall” – the uncrowned Raja of Mangoes.\\n\\nAbout the Mangoes of Malihabad\\nDid you know that India ranks first among world’s mango producing countries, accounting for 52.63 per cent of the total world’s mango production of 19 million tonnes ? Uttar Pradesh has the largest area of 0.27 million hectares under mango, and the major portion of it lie in the mango belt of Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nThe mango plantations of Malihabad were developed by Pathans, under the royal patronage of the Nawabs of Lucknow. Among the different varieties of mangoes grown in Malihabd, Dussheri is the most popular variety. Besides Dussehri, other varieties of mangoes such as Chausa, Fazli, Lucknowa, Jauhari, Safeda, etc. are also grown here.\\n\\nThe Ramada Lucknow team was warmly welcomed at Raja Saab’s abode, and got to know more about the fabled varieties of mangoes such as the Husenera, Mallika & Gulab Khas that make up for some divine culinary experiences. They also shared notes and tips (some of it completely innovative) that were intended to be a part of the Mango Weekend at Ramada Lucknow.\\n\\nThe team procured the best quality mangoes straight from the mango capital, which would form the central ingredient to the weekend celebration planned at Ramada Lucknow for 17-18 June 2017, both days inclusive.\\n\\nMango Festival, platform to increase income of farmers: Yogi\\nLucknow, July 14 (UNI) Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Friday that the markets of Europe are waiting for the mangoes of Uttar Pradesh and urged the farmers not to take shortcuts but to focus on quality and prepare products as per the demand of the market. Inaugurating the three-day UP Mango Festival 2023 at Avadh Shilpgram in Lucknow, Yogi said, \"In Russia, mangoes are being sold at Rs 800 per kg, but it costs Rs\\n190 to send mangoes through cargo from here. That means if a farmer exports mangoes to Russia, he will get a net profit of more than Rs 600. We have to take the mangoes from here to every corner of the world. The markets of Europe are waiting for the mangoes from UP.\" He asked the farmers to avoid shortcuts, prioritise quality, and prepare their products in accordance with market demands. \"Our government is working on the Beej Se Bazar Tak\\' (from seed to market) approach to increase the income of farmers.\\nThe CM said that during the Global Investors Summit, the government sent teams to a number of countries. \"We have to explore the global market for horticulture crops, and through Indian Missions abroad, we should organise exhibitions showcasing agricultural products related to UP,\" he said.\\nAsserting that the mango festival is a platform to increase the income of farmers, he said, \"As per Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s intention, the UP government is taking all necessary steps in the interest of the farmers.\"\\nYogi said, \"Our government has built four-pack houses in the state. Recently, we got the\\nopportunity to send two tonnes of mangoes to Dubai from the pack house in Varanasi, and we will have to organise similar program in the pack houses in Saharanpur, Amroha, and Lucknow.\" He said that in order to bring horticulture crops to the international market, agricultural scientists and officers of the Horticulture Department will need to work together. \"Only then will we be able to explore new avenues and give the agricultural and horticultural products of UP a different identity,\" he said.\\nProducers, buyers, sellers, and exporters participated in the mango festival. Aligarh\\'s mango buyer, Dr Mobinuddin Khan, said that CM Yogi\\'s effort resulted in a successful Aamras program in Russia\\'s capital, Moscow, last week.\\nMango seller Latish Bhatia from Bahrain said that this festival is very important for the mangoes of UP. \"We export two to three tonnes of mangoes every week. CM Yogi is constantly trying to give a new identity to the mangoes. This will greatly benefit the mango farmers as well as those doing business with mango products,\" he said.\\nBefore the programme, Yogi inspected an exhibition showcasing various products made from mangoes and released the souvenir of the Mango Festival 2023. He also felicitated farmers and traders from various districts of the state who have excelled in the field of mango production. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWebsite: \\n1. https://nowlucknow.com/save-the-date-for-the-lucknow-mango-festival-sunday-june-26/\\n2. https://www.knocksense.com/lucknow/check-out-all-thats-khaas-at-the-ongoing-mango-festival-in-lucknow\\n3. https://ramadalucknow.com/2017/06/14/mango-weekend-ramada-lucknow-journey-begins-malihabad/\\n4. https://www.uniindia.com/news/north/mango-festival-platform-to-increase-income-of-farmers-yogi/3010169.html\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The memorials were commissioned by the state’s former chief minister, Mayawati, herself a dalit. This essay analyzes intersections of politics, caste, gender, and visibility at two of her memorials in Lucknow—the Ambedkar Memorial and the Prerna Kendra (a crematory memorial). Specifically, the author argues that the forms and decoration of the memorials highlight the absence of earlier dalit leaders and present Mayawati as their legitimate political heir.\\n\\nEspecially in commemorative architecture (monuments, memorials, historic markers, museums), we learn whose histories are legitimate, which narratives are superfluous (or symbolically omitted), or which images are embraced as part of our official, national accounts of origins and destiny. We learn who is allowed to speak for history, who is allowed to speak for “us,” and whose voices will always be considered marginal to the main event.\\n\\n—Margaret E. Farrar\\n\\nThe past few years have witnessed radical additions to the built environment of Uttar Pradesh (U.P.), India’s largest and most populous state. Dozens of large-scale architectural memorials—enshrining narrative bronze friezes and monumental bronze and marble statues of social reformers associated with the historically oppressed dalit (formerly “untouchable”) caste—have been built in the state capital of Lucknow and in Noida, outside Delhi. These cities are now also punctuated by statues that stand sentinel at crowded intersections, outside government office buildings, and by the side of interstate highways, with smaller cement statues throughout the state’s rural areas. The memorial buildings and statues were commissioned by Mayawati (born 1956), herself a dalit, during her four terms as the U.P. chief minister between 1995 and 2012.[2] Mayawati’s memorials are the most conspicuous expression of establishing dalit visibility in her state. Others include renaming districts and prominent buildings to honor dalit heroes. The sheer number of the memorials, coupled with their monumental scale, arguably make Mayawati the single most prolific architectural patron in India since the British Raj commissioned New Delhi in 1911.\\n\\nThe cast of characters in Mayawati’s sculptural programs includes notable dalits and those who championed the rights of India’s subalterns. Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar (1891–1956), the dalit founder of the modern anti-caste movement and writer of the Indian constitution, is the best-known public figure in the statue cycles (fig. 1). Others include Jyotirao Phule (1827–1890), a campaigner for the education of women and low castes, and the Buddha, who preached against casteism and whose teachings many dalits have consequently adopted. Statues of Mayawati and Kanshi Ram (1934–2006), her mentor and predecessor in the Bajujan Samaj Party (BSP), are given pride of place in the memorials and often are duplicated several times at each site. With the monuments’ scale, their recognizable architectural forms and decoration, and the ubiquity of the dalit statues, Mayawati’s commissions have made an indelible mark on Uttar Pradesh’s urban fabric.\\nThe memorials aim to empower dalits through twin strategies, which Manuela Ciotti refers to as “presence in space,” and “presence in time,” both of which have been denied to the dalit community for centuries.[3] While the former offers visibility, the latter presents an illustrious dalit history, in which its members may take pride and aspire to a better future. When criticized for such flagrant expenditures, Mayawati consistently asserts that the memorials fulfill a vital social role and give hope and pride to her community.[4] As one dalit member of Mayawati’s cabinet remarked, “The statues have given Dalits a place in the history of this country, nobody can change that.”[5]\\n\\nDrawing from Foucault’s work on the relationship between space and power, Margaret E. Farrar remarks that those in power construct and reiterate social, political, and economic power structures in the built environment. The situation is circular: power shapes space and vice versa. Space legitimizes and ennobles some groups and excludes, denigrates, and silences others. Commemorative architecture is supremely exclusive and visually amplifies messages of communal belonging or segregation.[6] For centuries in India, dalits have been denied a presence in space and time, both literally and symbolically. This spatial and historical exclusion then perpetuates dalit social marginalization, inside and outside the community. It is therefore not surprising that the territorial claiming of physical space and marking it with dalit historical figures—thereby visually demanding that they are recognized—is an integral component of Mayawati’s radical brand of dalit assertion.\\n\\nThe sprawling Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Prateek Sthal (hereafter referred to by its popular name, the Ambedkar Memorial) with its monumental Ambedkar stupā (figs. 1, 2) and the Bahujan Samaj Prerna Kendra (hereafter, Prerna Kendra; fig. 3), both in Lucknow, are Mayawati’s most politically meaningful architectural commissions. The Prerna Kendra is unique in that it is a funerary memorial that enshrines Kanshi Ram’s cremated ashes. In commissioning her predecessor’s memorial, Mayawati was participating in a well-established Indic performance of legitimating political authority. As with her other architectural commissions, the Ambedkar Memorial and Prerna Kendra’s formal and decorative programs, statues, and frieze cycles, as well as the commemorative rituals held at the sites, work in concert to unite dalits in a singular “imagined community” and establish Mayawati as their rightful charismatic leader. Images and text present Mayawati as the political heir to the most celebrated figures in dalit history, designating Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram, and Mayawati as charismatic leaders by referring to models of Indic kingship and linking Mawayawati to more recent examples of gendered authority. I employ the term “charismatic leader” in accordance with Max Weber’s definition:\\n... a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities. These are such as are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them, the individual is treaded as a leader....What is alone important is how the individual is actually regarded by those subject to the charismatic authority, by his “followers” or “disciples.”\\nSignificantly, Weber suggests that what matters most is that followers believe a leader possesses exceptional characteristics—not that he or she actually possesses them. Like many leaders who seek to convince their followers of their extraordinariness, Mayawati announces her unique and exceptional powers through monumental public art with straightforward messages and meaningful, archaized styles.\\n\\nAlso pertinent for understanding the artworks in the Ambedkar Memorial and the Prerna Kendra are Weber’s notions about how charisma may be transmitted (“the routinization of charisma”) from one leader to another. These include designation by the previous charismatic leader and being descended from him.[8] Mayawati explicitly references the former and implicitly suggests the latter in the statues and friezes in her buildings. Weber also cites support—followers’ lavish donations and gifts—as a marker of an individual’s charismatic authority,[9] which has parallels in institutions of traditional Indic kingship. Mayawati has been the recipient of extravagant gifts from her constituents, a fact that is highlighted in her commissions.[10]\\n\\nIt is not surprising that Mayawati has invested so heavily in a politically charged visual culture and performances of her own charisma. When she first ran for office, she was an unlikely candidate as chief minister. While she was not the first dalit chief minister in India, she was the first woman from her community to hold the office as well as the youngest in the state. Coupled with her extravagant public displays of wealth and acceptance of gifts from her community, Mayawati’s prolific memorial building activity has consistently garnered her both national criticism and praise. The dalit community itself is divided in its support of her building programs. Many dalits to whom I spoke at her sites unanimously and enthusiastically supported her and echoed her rhetoric of the necessity of her community building program. Both factions have received ample media exposure.\\nThe dalit movement and Mayawati’s political career have been the subject of several recent studies.[12] Nicholas Jaoul[13] and Gary Michael Tartakov[14] examine emerging trends in dalit visual culture, particularly the increasing prevalence of Ambedkar statues in rural Uttar Pradesh. They did not consider Mayawati’s monumental urban statues, presumably because this now statewide phenomenon was only in its nascent stages during the time of their fieldwork. Focusing her analyses on its architectural form and location, Maxine Loynd cogently argues that the Prerna Kendra was created as an intimate, exclusive dalit communal space, quite different from the Ambedkar Memorial.[15] However, Loynd’s study does not consider the building’s mortuary roles and is silent on the subject of its decorative program, whose thematic content highlights Mayawati’s political lineage and charisma. Thus, a critical study of these two buildings, their statues, and friezes within her wider political agenda has yet to be undertaken. Before turning to the memorials themselves, it is pertinent to first briefly consider dalit history and key figures esteemed by the community with whom Mayawati visually associates through her commissions.\\n\\nDalit—derived from the Sanskrit and Marathi word meaning “ground down, crushed, destroyed”—is an inclusive term that members of India’s various lowest castes have used to refer to themselves since the early twentieth century. Rebuking the Gandhian term harījān (people of God) as patronizing, Ambedkar defiantly adopted and popularized dalit. Historically dalits’ hereditary occupations, which in Hinduism are associated with caste, have been characterized by literal and ritual pollution. For generations, members of various dalit groups were in contact with corpses (removing dead humans and animals, working with leather, and butchering); served as sweepers; and performed other menial jobs.[16] This pollution is popularly regarded as contagious, leading to forced dalit segregation in their areas of habitation (predominantly in slums), at religious sites, and at water sources. Dalits had no recourse or means to better themselves; until the mid-twentieth century, education was largely denied to them. Numerous social schemes have been implemented since Indian independence in 1947 to rectify this, such as reservations for dalits in schools, universities, government jobs, and political offices. Perhaps the greatest single public triumph for the community was the 1997 democratic election of dalit K. R. Narayanan as president of India. However, while such concessions and appointments have markedly improved the dalits’ opportunities for upward social and financial mobility, they remain among the poorest and most socially marginalized people in the nation.\\n\\nSources differ on the roots of this discrimination and precisely how long it has been in effect. Brahmanical texts dating to the first millennium BCE outline the various Hindu castes and note the existence of those outside of the order, who are thus “untouchable.” However, since Ambedkar’s campaigns dating from the 1930s to 1950s, communal pride and assertiveness has grown steadily. A key factor has been the creation of dalit “presence in time” and the construction of an alternative dalit history, which presents the community as the former possessors of wealth, positions of power, and education—the very qualities popular history denies them. According to these new trajectories, in the ancient past, kṣhatryǎs (rulers and warriors of the Hindu caste system) and Brahmans (members of the priestly caste) divested dalits of their lofty positions by treachery and relegated them to the lowest social positions. Whether or not these ancient histories are true is not the point. Explanation, pride, and hope are. These alternative histories offer the community a reason for their present subaltern status, a group of role models, and by extension, a hope that they may achieve equality, if not regain their former status\\nThe BSP has made concerted efforts to increase dalit awareness of key historical community members of whom they can be proud. Figures from the ancient past include sages such as Valmiki, the author of the Ramayana. More recent notable figures include female dalit martial heroes (viranganī) martyred during the 1857 rebellion against the British. The most celebrated contemporary dalit heroes are Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram, and Mayawati. In fact, Mayawati worked closely with Kanshi Ram to fashion her charismatic public image and promote her qualifications to lead the community by visually associating her with both Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram.[18]\\n\\nMayawati’s memorial commissions are key strategies in the visual articulation of her political lineage from these two male dalit leaders and her claims to charismatic authority. Her buildings and statues are metaphorical lighthouses and visual rallying points, from which the BSP is able to mobilize the community to vote for their candidates, who then will demand more rights and better opportunities on the dalits’ behalf. These messages are amplified through a scale that is larger than life; through construction from costly, durable materials that are historically associated with royalty and political authority; and finally, through historically meaningful styles.\\n\\nThe tradition of public memorialization through sculptures and public buildings in India began with the British, who installed bronze and marble images of the imperial family and high-ranking Raj civil servants and commissioned buildings such as museums and railway stations in their honor. After independence, colonial statues were largely removed and replaced by ones depicting nationalist heroes, particularly freedom fighters such as Gandhi, the Raṇī of Jhansi, and Bhagat Singh. Public buildings were also renamed, but in honor of figures who were almost exclusively from the higher castes, thereby effectively excluding dalits from Indian postcolonial history and public memorial space. In the early 1960s, Ambedkar joined his upper-caste nationalist cohorts when two public bronze statues of him were erected, one in Mumbai, the other in front of the National Parliament in New Delhi.\\nThese two statues established an Ambedkar iconography: dressed in a suit, tie, and glasses, and holding one hand up with the index finger punctuating the air.[19] The Mumbai statue added the Indian constitution, tucked under Ambedkar’s lowered arm, inscribed with “Bharat” (India) to ensure its meaning (see fig. 1). Both Mayawati’s statues and the smaller-scale cement statues dalits install in their villages and slums are based on these models.[20]\\n\\nSince Mayawati first came to office in the mid-1990s, public dalit statues, particularly those of Ambedkar, have increased exponentially. Today in Lucknow, Ambedkar has a more conspicuous public presence than Gandhi does. At the main intersection of Hajarat Ganj, a fashionable historic shopping district, an older statue of Gandhi has been joined by a larger and newer Ambedkar companion statue across the street. Such visual one-upping was surely not unintentional. In fact, this is a trope in Mayawati’s commissions, expressed through scale and text. Gandhi and Ambedkar clashed on several occasions over the issue of caste; while opposing inequality, Gandhi maintained that there were social and cultural benefits to the system. Ambedkar campaigned for its abolition. While Gandhi is popularly honored as the father of the nation, dalit activists such as Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram, and particularly Mayawati have publically denounced him on the basis that he did nothing to improve their situation. In memorializing notable figures from her own community through buildings and statues, and renaming districts after them, Mayawati was subscribing to and amplifying performances of autonomy established by the independent nation.\\nMayawati’s commissions established iconographies for Kanshi Ram’s and her own images as well (fig. 4). Kanshi Ram is dressed in a casual suit, and Mayawati has cropped hair; a plain, loose-fitting shalwaar kameez; chunky sandals; a prominent wristwatch; and a handbag at her side. Her simple, unadorned appearance depicts her as unfussy and androgynous. The message conveyed is that she is fully capable of negotiating the male-dominated political arena. Her distinctly unfeminine appearance also highlights her unmarried status, and by extension, her complete dedication to the betterment of her community, which she confirms when questioned about her marital status.\\nNeither Mayawati’s public identity nor her self-promotion of it through monumental images is unique within the visual culture of Indian politics, and there were well-established models available to her all over India. Among these, as Sikata Banerjee documents, are women in the Hindutva movement who, like Mayawati, present themselves as celibate, masculine, and martial to participate in the masculine world of Hindu nationalism.[22] The most common trope of female politician in India is the asexual widow, such as Vijayraje Scindia. Like Mayawati, Hindu nationalist women and Hindu widows who have entered politics wear plain clothing and minimal jewelry and makeup.[23] Perhaps Mayawati’s androgynous dress and physique as well as her statues bear the closest resemblance to those of Jayalalitha Jayaram, the former actress and chief minister of Tamil Nadu, who entered politics and began promoting herself through public art a few years before Mayawati. In many regards, the two politicians have similar careers. Both have backgrounds that do not recommend them for Indian politics (Mayawati as a dalit and Jayalalitha as a former film heroine, a profession widely regarded as immoral for women in India). Both claim to have remained unmarried so that they can dedicate themselves to their political parties. As will be discussed further, two prominent tropes in Jayalalitha’s and Mayawati’s artistic commissions are their descent from their male political mentors and their conspicuous political promotion, which announce their charismatic authority.\\n\\nTamil Nadu has a well-established history of male actors who enter into political careers. As Preminda Jacob states in her work on the art of cinema and political advertisements in the state, one of the typical means by which actors-turned-politicians promote themselves is through monumental banners and cutouts (outlines of figures) that are stylistically based on film advertisements.[24] Since the 1980s, Jayalalitha has commissioned more banners and cutouts, which are larger and display more overt political symbolism, than any other politician in the state. Her public image and political advertisements certainly have served her well; Jayalalitha has achieved incredible success, attaining landslide victories in state elections on three occasions. She and her advertisements are well publicized in the Indian media, and Mayawati surely is familiar with them.\\nAnother significant factor to the deconstruction of Mayawati’s public image is that in the 1990s Jayalalitha’s promotional images shifted dramatically in their depictions, changing from her wholesome and feminine film roles to a distinctly androgynous appearance. She now appears in the banners and cutouts with her hair in a tight bun and her fleshy physique concealed in a conservatively draped sari and cape. To shift public focus from her film career, in which her success hinged on her sexuality, to her charismatic authority, Jayalalitha desexed herself.[25] In so doing, she likely provided a model for Mayawati. However, as is typical of Mayawati’s commissions, they surpass their models. The Tamil banners and cutouts are two-dimensional and ephemeral. They are constructed of plywood, supported by bamboo scaffolding, and displayed only for a few weeks. In contrast, Mayawati commissions buildings and statues of durable, luxury materials to convey her wealth and ensure both their permanence and their patron’s public memory.\\n\\nWhile Jayalalitha’s androgyny may be attributed to her desire to distance herself from her film-star past in an effort to be taken seriously as a politician, Mayawati had different, yet equally compelling reasons to publically desex herself. In her analysis of gender among scheduled castes,[26] Eva-Maria Hardtman draws attention to the fact that the few low-caste Indian women who rise to positions of political power are subject to intense moral scrutiny by the media, male members of their own political parties, and the entertainment industry.[27] There is far less speculation about the morality of Indian high- and middle-caste female politicians (unless they are former film stars) or male politicians, whatever their caste. Untouchables have popularly been considered impure and their touch defiling. Dalit women have the added stigma of being widely considered immoral and promiscuous.\\nHardtman cites the late dalit outlaw-turned-politician Phoolan Devi and Mayawati as examples. Among the multiple atrocities committed against the former was being gang-raped on several occasions and paraded naked, which were then exposed in a book and internationally best-selling film, Bandit Queen, without her permission. Phoolan Devi denounced the film in particular, likening it to being raped again.[29] In 1996 a male politician publically accused Mayawati of engaging in a long-term affair with Kanshi Ram that resulted in a secret love child. The accusation received widespread coverage in the Indian media for several months.[30] It cannot be coincidental that photographs of Mayawati taken until 1997 show her with shoulder-length hair pulled back into a ponytail, wearing a pastel-pink shalwaar kameez or occasionally a sari, and gold jewelry. About a year after the accusation, Mayawati cropped her hair and has since appeared exclusively in a shapeless, cream-colored shalwaar kameez, which is how she is immortalized in her statues. Phoolan Devi and Mayawati are both also well known for their public cursing and for addressing upper-caste males in the derogatory third-person, tu—behaviors associated with low-caste males in India. It would appear that for these two dalit female politicians, androgyny and the adoption of stereotypically low-caste masculine behaviors were protective responses to having their private lives and morality the subject of public consumption.\\nMayawati was born into the chamar jatī, one of the lowest dalit subcastes, whose members have historically been tanners. Positive accounts of Mayawati’s biography emphasize her dedication to her studies at a young age and her academic success; her higher degrees include a law degree (LLB). In 1977, she was studying for her civil service examinations when she met Kanshi Ram, who was establishing the BSP at the time. Kanshi Ram groomed Mayawati as a party leader, and in 2001, at a large rally in Lucknow, he named her as his successor as president of the BSP (fig. 5).[31] When he suffered a paralyzing stroke in 2004, he convalesced at Mayawati’s home in Delhi while she personally cared for and fed him. When he died in 2006, as per the tenets of his will, he was cremated in a Buddhist ritual, and Mayawati personally lit his funeral pyre.[32]\\n\\nIn both Hinduism and Buddhism, performance of the last rites is the final responsibility of a father’s eldest son and heir. By taking on this central and traditionally male role in Kanshi Ram’s funeral, Mayawati challenged gender discrimination and decisively established herself as the heir of Kanshi Ram. Her action also suggested a more intimate, familial descent from the founder of the party and, by extension, her inheritance of his charismatic authority through two well-established paths: designation by the previous leader or descent from him. Kanshi Ram’s cremated ashes were placed in an urn, which was processed in a cortege through Lucknow and which Mayawati personally installed under bronze statues of the two of them in the Prerna Kendra.[33] These two acts—Kanshi Ram’s announcement that Mayawati was his successor and her performance of his last rites—irrefutably established her as his heir apparent. The two occasions are also among the most popular subjects in the bronze friezes in Mayawati’s memorials.\\nThat Kanshi Ram specified that he receive his last rites according to Buddhist tradition is also significant. Although neither he nor Mayawati formally converted to the faith, Buddhism has been politically and religiously associated with the dalit movement since Ambedkar’s highly public conversion in 1956. Adding another layer to dalit alternative history, Ambedkar asserted that members of India’s lowest castes were Buddhists who had been ostracized for not accepting Hinduism.[34] Since Ambedkar’s conversion, the faith has undergone a profound revival among dalits, who seek to cast off the stigma of their low status and shun the system that degraded them for centuries. As several dalit Buddhists noted during conversations with me, they subscribe to Ambedkar’s claims and view their conversion as a reconversion to the faith and a reclaiming of their history.[35] Due to the dalit revival of Buddhism; its associations with Ambedkar, the founder of the modern dalit movement; and Ambedkar’s assertions that dalits were previously Buddhists, Mayawati’s dalit memorials quote liberally from ancient Indian Buddhist monuments. Ultimately the neo-Buddhist style of Mayawati’s memorials makes a dalit “presence in time” visual.\\n“A Modern-day Female Ashoka”: Claiming Dalit Space and Establishing a Dalit Style of Architecture\\nAll of Mayawati’s sculptures are executed by Ram and Anil Sutar, a father-and-son, Noida-based team. Ram Suthar graduated at the top of his class from one of India’s most prestigious art schools, the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art, in 1953. Significant to the work he would later do for Mayawati, during the 1950s, Ram Sutar served as modeler for the Department of Archaeology in Aurangabad and restored sculptures in the Ellora and Ajanta caves, which familiarized him with ancient Indian Buddhist art. Since he established his own studio in 1959, Ram Sutar’s national fame has grown steadily. He has been commissioned to cast and carve statues and friezes of a diverse range of public and mythological figures throughout India. Sutar is best known for his bust of Gandhi, which has been recast multiple times and which the government of India has given to numerous countries. In 1995 Sutar was awarded the prestigious Padmashri medal.[36]\\n\\nMayawati doubtlessly chose the Sutars for their reputation as the most celebrated sculptors to work in a large scale and for the realism, dynamism, and quality materials that characterize their work. That the Sutars are well known for their sculptures of Hindu subjects and high-caste leaders was probably also attractive. Their past work associated Mayawati and her community with the establishment and the galaxy of national heroes. By retaining their services, she effectively communicated that now dalits too have access to the finest quality materials and the most sought-after artists to memorialize their heroes.\\n\\nShe was an active agent in the construction and dissemination of her public image. The Sutars and Jay Kaktikar, Mayawati’s chief architect, discussed building and decorative styles and their associations with her at great length. She then became highly involved in the design and planning of her commissions.[37] While in office, she frequently toured the building sites from the air in her private helicopter. Her commissions certainly have kept the artists in her employ busy. Both Kaktikar and the Sutars work exclusively for her. When Mayawati first retained the Sutars’ services in the early 2000s, they only employed twenty-four full-time workers in their foundry, and they only worked during the day. When I met the Sutars in August 2011, when Mayawati was still in office, to keep up with her commissions, they had increased their workforce to one hundred during the day and another one hundred at night. Their foundry was open twenty-fours a day, seven days a week. Still, they were backlogged with work for Mayawati.\\n\\nIt was not only the rate of her commissions that kept her artists busy, it was their quality. Kaktikar recounts that Mayawati insisted that her projects be constructed with an aim toward permanence. Her great concern was that after her tenure, her non-dalit successors would raze what she had built. Her fears were certainly well founded. Throughout India memorial statues of Ambedkar and other dalit icons are routinely vandalized—toppled, defaced, or garlanded with rows of shoes, with the aim of insulting them. Only months after she was voted out of office in 2012, statues of Mayawati and Ambedkar were decapitated in Lucknow.[39] In an attempt to ensure that Uttar Pradesh was not subjected to further visual programs to erase the dalits from Lucknow’s built environment, Kaktikar worked with thicker than usual slabs of stone, and the Sutars cast Mayawati’s statues and friezes with extra thick bronze.\\n\\nMayawati and Kaktikar devised an instantly recognizable style for her architectural commissions through their formal and decorative programs and construction material. Patron and architect perfectly understood the sociopolitical need not only to build but also to claim space and territorially mark it through a sectarian style of architecture. Mayawati’s buildings draw heavily from ancient Indian Buddhist architecture, as exemplified by sites such as the Great Stupa at Sanchi (circa first century BCE). Kaktikar notes that he and Mayawati intended to appropriate this style. Her buildings are not pastiches. Rather than recreating facsimiles of ancient Buddhist structures, Kaktikar combined select features from notable Indian buildings to associate his patron and her community with politically legitimizing models.\\n\\nThe construction materials are uniform light-pink and red sandstone from Karuli, Rajasthan, and buff-colored sandstone from Chunar, Uttar Pradesh. As with all of her commissions, Mayawati’s choice of materials was well informed and meaningful. Red sandstone and white marble have been the preeminent building materials for royal and government structures in North India since the fourteenth-century Khilji Sultan Ala-ud-din’s commission of the Alai Darwaza at the Qutub complex in Delhi. Following the Khiljis, other Delhi Sultanates, the Mughals, several Rajput dynasties, the British, and finally the independent nation of India employed these building materials for their political structures. Light-pink sandstone is frequently substituted for white marble. Mayawati’s use of these materials brings her into the visual language of North Indian rulership.\\n\\nChunar sandstone is deeply associated with the third-century BCE Mauryan emperor Ashoka, who was a great patron of Buddhism and its arts. Ashoka raised freestanding columns carved from Chunar sandstone throughout his vast empire upon which were inscribed edicts. In an effort to associate herself with one of the greatest figures from Buddhist history, Mayawati similarly erected dozens of Chunar sandstone columns on the grounds of her monuments (fig. 6). Her pillars are not facsimiles of the Ashokan pillars. While the former are constructed exclusively of sandstone and present a variety of animals, upturned lotuses, and wheels on their capitals, Mayawati’s pillars are more uniform. Their bronze capitals are capped by wheels borne on the backs of four addorsed elephants. Here, the elephants carry polysemic meanings: they are symbols of Indic authority; are associated with Ashoka, as they are featured on several of his capitals; and are the BSP party symbol. These messages also are carried by the dozens of life-size, carved stone elephants that punctuate the grounds of Mayawati’s buildings. The Ashokan pillars were erected singly, but Mayawati’s are in clusters. Furthermore, Kaktikar notes that, per Mayawati’s orders, her columns are slightly taller than Ashoka’s. The association between Mayawati and Ashoka has not been lost on her community. Biku Chandra Ma, a dalit Buddhist monk at the Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Gomti Buddha Vihar, a monastic residence in Lucknow (commissioned by Mayawati), proudly asserted: “Mayawati is just like a modern-day female Ashoka.”[40] Perhaps the message she seeks to deploy through the abundance, more permanent material of bronze, and superior height of her pillars is not simply that she is like the great emperor, but that she has in fact surpassed him.\\nIn likening herself to great leaders from India’s ancient past, Mayawati again subscribes to popular performances of charismatic authority in recent Indian politics. Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister, is also known to have emulated Ashoka as a model of Indic sovereignty. He chose icons such as the Ashokan lion capital and the wheel to represent the new independent nation.[41] More recently, in 1995, Jayalalitha erected numerous banners and cutouts of herself surrounded by eminent ancient Tamil leaders at the World Tamil Conference in Thanjavur. In several banners, she appeared next to the most celebrated Chola emperor, Raja Raja I (reigned 985–1015 CE) and images of his monumental Brihadeshvara temple. [42] Like Mayawati’s “Ashokan” pillars, Jayalalitha’s visual propaganda focused on an ancient leader’s monument that signified his glorious rule, constructed a fictive lineage, and presented her own rule as a revival of a Golden Age.[43]\\n\\nThe exterior parameters of Mayawati’s architectural commissions are bound by sandstone railings whose forms and low reliefs of chaitya arches are appropriated from the vedikas (stupā railings) at ancient Buddhist sites such as Sanchi (fig. 7). Because the first phase of construction at the Sanchi Stupa was a Mauryan commission, Mayawati’s railings further her Ashokan associations. Like the pillars, the railings are not copied exactly from their original sources. While ancient Buddhist vedikas offer detailed reliefs of a variety of subjects associated with Buddhism, those at Mayawati’s sites are largely devoid of carvings. Representations of yakshīs (fertile nymphs) and other figures from the Buddhist pantheon and scenes from the jatakas would be inappropriate at the Ambedkar Memorial and the Prerna Kendra. While informed tangentially by Buddhism, the faith and its architectural styles are employed in the service of politics in Mayawati’s commissions. These are not sites built to honor the Buddha. It could even be argued that their ultimate function is not to honor Ambedkar or Kanshi Ram, but Mayawati.\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Even today, Lucknow acts as a hub of education and research with a number of premier educational institutions being located in and around the city. The capital city of Uttar Pradesh has enjoyed the privilege of being home to some highly reputed colleges and schools in India.\\nThe La Martinière College finds a place among the most eagerly sought institutions of the city that provide secondary education. The college was founded in conformity with the will of General Claude Martin, who was born in Lyon, France, in the year 1735.\\nThe founder of La Martinière College, Claude Martin was an officer in the British army in India, who died in Lucknow in 1800. He left a will according to his which, some funds were allocated for the development of schools in Lyon, Calcutta and Lucknow. He also mentioned that his house at Constantia House, college building and the adjoining ground should never be sold or auctioned. The purpose of Claude Martin’s will was to preserve the Constantia House for imparting English education to young men. The day of the death of General Claude Martin is remembered and celebrated as “Founders Day” in La Martinière College every year.\\nThe Founder – Claude Martin\\nThe La Martinière Boys College was established by a donation from the affluent 18th century Frenchman, Major General Claude Martin. He was a Major in the French Army, who later joined the East India Company’s Bengal Army.\\nThe General is said to have acquired most of his wealth from his ventures while serving at Lucknow under Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula of Awadh. He was considered the richest Frenchman during that time in India. The palatial Constantia House, which now accommodates the famous La Martinière College, was constructed in 1785 as the general’s residence on the extreme east end of Lucknow city. However, the Mansion of Constantia could not be completed until 1802. Unfortunately, Claude Martin died on 13th September, 1800, before Constantia House could be completed.\\nMany historians are of the opinion that the house of Claude Martin took its name from the college’s motto Labore et Constantia. There are other historians, who put forward an unconfirmed view that the complex was named after a young French girl Constance, who many think was Claude Martin’s first love.\\nIt is generally believed that Claude Martin was driven not just by pride but by an aspiration to protect his personal property and belongings even after his death. He did not want his family members or friends to inherit his personal belongings or property after his death. According to his will, he wanted himself to be buried under Constantia House as he feared that the structure might be desecrated after his death. Claude Martin was buried in a specially-made cellar in the basement of Constantia House.\\nHence, Constantia House became both a mausoleum and a college. It is considered to be the largest European funereal memorial in India. Famous historian and poet William Dalrymple has even described it as British East India Company’s apt answer to the colossal Taj Mahal.\\nThe Early Years of La Martinière\\nAfter the death of Claude Martin, there were prolonged legal disputes in the court regarding his will. The will of Martin was proved only in 1840 in the Calcutta High Court. In the meantime, the building was utilized as a guesthouse for foreign dignitaries and visiting officials.\\nThe college was opened on 1st October, 1845 with just 70 boys. Mr. John Newmarch was the first principal of La Martinière College. Initially, only Eurasians and Europeans were allowed to get their boys enrolled in the college. Unlike the Calcutta branch, the Constantia House of Lucknow was officially established outside the East India Company’s area, hence its interaction with the local population was frequent.\\nLa Martinière during the Mutiny of 1857\\nThe Mutiny of 1857 in Lucknow saw military events at the La Martinière campus. The East India Company called the students of La Martinière College to help the British troops to help defend the British Residency in Lucknow. The names of 67 boys and 8 staff members, who were a part of the plan, are engraved on the Roll of Honor at La Martinière Lucknow.\\nThe rebellion started on 30th June, 1857 and Sir Henry Lawrence instructed the evacuation of La Martinière. Several school boys used to travel from the British Residency to their college gathering military provisions. The military force within the British Residency comprised British and Indian soldiers and even civil volunteers including quite a few Anglo Indians.\\nThe Martinière group of boys was headed by Mr. George Schilling, who was the principal of the college. The Residency in Lucknow was under attack for 86 days, until it was freed by Sir Colin Campbell in the month of November 1857.\\nThe Present State of La Martinière College\\nLa Martinière is a premier boy’s college situated in Lucknow. The college is affiliated to ICSE Board and is high on the list of schools that parents’ want to get their boys enrolled into. The marvelous French architecture of the colossal monument and its glorious past has added to the charm of the college among the city residents. The Constantia has perfectly stood the test of time to be home to one of the leading schools in North India even after  more than 150 years of its establishment.\\nThe city people still prefer to address the Constantia as Martin Saheb Ki Kothi (Bunglow of Claude Martin) in Martin Purwa area, beyond Bandariya Bagh. The building is unquestionably one of the most outstanding European structures of the city. It is well preserved and is efficiently being handled by the college administration. The former principals, administrators and teachers, not to forget the current administration, deserve accolades for their sincere efforts in the preservation and maintaining the rich legacy of the Constantia.\\nDilkusha Kothi was built in the 18th century in the English Baroque style of architecture and is one of the most popular historical places in Lucknow. Not much remains of the structure but a few towers and the external walls of the monument. The surrounding garden adds to the beauty and old-world charm of the monnument.  \\nIf there is one thing that Lucknow stands out for, it is its regal and royal aura. There is a touch of richness from the monuments to the cuisine.\\nThe magnificent and extraordinary Dilkusha Palace is located in the cantonment area of Lucknow, to the northeast of Raj Bhavan.\\nYou can see the ruins of a mansion constructed in the English baroque style in the eighteenth century near Dilkusha Kothi. Even though it is now in ruins, the remnants are a clear testament to its erstwhile artistic beauty and excellent architecture.\\nIt still has a regal air to show it is a building with a lot of historical and cultural value. Some of the most exciting moments in Indian history have taken place there. It is one of Lucknow\\'s lesser-known historical sites and one of the top tourist attractions of Lucknow.\\nDilkusha Kothi, often referred to as the English house or Vilayati Kothi, was constructed during the rule of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan.\\nArchitecture of Dilkusha Kothi\\nOne of Lucknow\\'s most magnificent monuments, the Dilkusha Kothi, is built in the Baroque architectural style. It is close to the Lucknow cantonment area in the NER colony.\\nYou\\'ll observe that the building lacks a courtyard, which is strange because that was quite uncommon during those times. Additionally, the Delaval Hall of Seaton bears a striking resemblance to the design.\\nThe Dilkusha Kothi\\'s main structure is located on the western section of the north-south axis. This was made specifically for the Nawab. It was a palace that the Nawab held dear, which is why it was given the name \"Dil Kusha,\" which translates to \"happy heart.\"\\nWilliam Howard Russell, a renowned Times journalist, reported that Lucknow was the most beautiful City he had ever seen and that it was more lovely than Rome, Athens, and Constantinople.\\nIt is built on a higher platform facing west, which can only be comprehended by looking at the bastions surrounding it. Additionally, the ruins show that the guard room was one of a series of small chambers on one side.\\nThe building\\'s roof was entirely demolished during the conflict in 1857, further damaging the eastern side and ruining the brilliant architectural design. The Palace has been repaired, thanks to the Government and the Archeological Survey of India.\\nMary Linley Taylor, a British actress who lives in Seoul, South Korea\\'s Jongno neighborhood, decided to name her home \"Dilkusha\" after her visit to the Dilkusha Kothi.\\nAnother mansion with outstanding architecture and an Indo-European design is located northeast of this structure. The two-story castle is constructed with lime mortar and Lakhauri bricks.\\nIt looks gorgeous with the white plaster all over it. Given that the location was enveloped with thick jungles and deadly wild animals, the palaces served as hunting lodges and vacation resorts.\\nHistory behind Dilkusha Kothi\\nMajor Gore Ouseley, a British resident and close friend of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan, the then-ruler of Oudh, created the Dilkusha Kothi in the 18th century. Although it also operated as a summer resort, it was initially constructed as a hunting lodge for the Nawabs.\\nThe Dilkusha Kothi, now one of the top sightseeing spots in Lucknow, was once utilized by the Begums (wives of Nawabs) as a location to unwind, rest, and take picnics because of its proximity to the river. This location lacked a separate zenana (women\\'s room), a characteristic of all Nawabi structures, which is noteworthy.\\nThe structure underwent additional modifications during the reign of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. He was the tenth and last Nawab of Awadh. During the early years of his administration, he was the one who constructed another Kothi just next to it. He did this so that he could organize military drills for his soldiers.\\nThe British, extremely upset by this act, commanded him to cease all further drills. The Nawab felt pretty upset and helpless as a result. He was compelled to resign by the British not long after that. He was unlawfully removed from office due to his refusal to sign his abdication statement before doing so.\\nBut during the siege of Lucknow, the Palace was destroyed, and gunshot holes could be seen on every wall, a loud reminder of the courageous freedom fighters\\' sacrifice. With the aid of British troops, Sir Colin Campbell, the Commander-in-Chief at the time, seized control of the Palace in November 1857.\\nHow Dilkusha Kothi stands today\\nThe structure suffered considerably after the siege of Lucknow in 1857 and was destroyed by the 1880s. The Indian Archaeological Survey has been working on its restoration for several years.\\nIn the current situation, Dilkusha Kothi is a destroyed palace surrounded by large yet constrained Dilkusha Gardens. The large gardens are still present, although the monument consists of a few towers and external walls. In addition, a magnificent mansion northeast of this structure was constructed in the Indo-European style.\\nEven if there aren\\'t many people around in the summer, things are very different in the winter. Numerous tourists from various countries travel there to visit the location. Many people, including children and teenagers, view this as a great picnic location where they spend the entire day with friends and family.\\nThis location is surrounded by history, nature, and peace and is ideal for reflective conversations. Despite being close to the busy Charbagh railway station, this location is serene, especially in the winter.\\nYou can\\'t help but be moved by the sight of the Dilkusha Kothi and the events that took place here when you see it now. It appears as though the building is lamenting the sacrifices and lives lost. The air is heavy with nothingness, and nostalgia overtakes you in the midst of it all.\\nEntry fee and timings of Dilkusha Kothi\\nThe entry fee for Indian visitors is Rs. 5 and Rs.100 for international tourists. It is open daily from 8 am to 6 pm.\\nDilkusha Kothi is fairly large, so allow at least an hour to complete your visit and click some amazing photographs.\\nBest time to visit Dilkusha Kothi\\nThe soothing weather conditions during the winter season in Lucknow welcome hordes of tourists every year to Dilkusha Kothi The mildly chilly nights and fresh wind during the day make perfect conditions for exploring the lovely City.\\nPack some warm clothing to keep you comfortable on chilly nights.\\nThe heat waves that frequently strike this area throughout the summer make it uncomfortable to travel through the City. The same is true of rainy days, where unexpected downpours might ruin your daily schedule, and the humidity will not allow you to step out.\\nSchedule your trip during the pleasant winter months of October to March to experience Lucknow at its best.\\nHow to reach Dilkusha Kothi?\\nLucknow has a good transportation network that includes aircraft, trains, and buses that connect it to other regions of the nation. Numerous planes connect the city with different regions of the world through Lucknow Airport in Amausi.\\nTrain travelers can reserve their seats up till Lucknow\\'s Charbagh railway station. One can also take state and private buses from neighboring cities and towns to Lucknow.\\nBy air: The Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Amausi, also known as Lucknow Airport, is located approximately 15 kilometers from the City\\'s center and connects it to all the main Indian cities. Travelers can use pre-paid taxis, cabs outside the airport, or bus service to get anywhere in Lucknow.\\nBy train: The large rail network links Lucknow with the rest of the country through the Charbagh Railway Station in the city\\'s center. Regular trains are available from New Delhi, Kolkata, Patna, Kolkata, and Chennai to Lucknow.\\nBy bus: It\\'s also a fantastic alternative to going from nearby cities to Lucknow by car. Numerous deluxe, luxury, Volvo, and state buses are frequently available for Lucknow.\\nOnce you are in Lucknow, the several commutes available throughout the City make traveling easy.

Dilkusha Kothi is one such top tourist attraction of Lucknow that welcomes tourists from across the country to experience history.\\nIt is incredible to consider how much history has transpired in front of these ancient walls and how much these walls have heard or witnessed, from Nawabs to modern-day tourists. They have seen the development of the location\\'s shape and magnificence from nothing to now.\\nTomb of Saadat Ali Khan,One of the most popular Nawabs of Awadh, Saadat Ali Khan, and his wife Khurshid Zadi rest in peace in this tomb. The intricate architecture and the beautiful garden around the tomb attract many visitors to this historical site.Not-so-lofty in size yet renowned for it’s brilliant artistry, Maqbara of Saadat Ali Khan is one-such famous landmark of the city. Situated near Begum Hazrat Mahal Park, this beautifully designed structure was built by Nawab Ghazi-ud-Din Haider and was meant to serve as a mausoleum for his father Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. Nawab Saadat Ali Khan’s Maqbara is built in the Indo-Islamic style of architecture. The walls of the facade has fine stucco work done on it. It also has turrets and a huge dome which is further embellished with an inverted guldasta over it. Atop the guldasta is fixed a pointed, narrow rod which aims at the sky. The building has it’s floor chequered with black and white marbles and it’s walls adorned with several arched doors and windows. ‘Lakhauri bricks and locally available mortar was used to build this structure. Had this Maqbara been built with white marble, it would have transcended the beauty of Taj Mahal’, states the famous historian, Mr. Roshan Taqui. Just like Asifi Masjid, initially this Maqbara had rooms at the base of it. But it was later when they were closed permanently. The tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan’s wife Murshidzaadi lies adjacent to his Maqbara.\\nIt was in the year 1814 when Nawab Saadat Ali Khan died and his son Ghazi-ud-Din Haider came to the throne, shifting from his previous residence to Chhatar Manzil, which once used to be his father’s palace. Nawab Ghazi-ud-Din Haider was overwhelmed to take over his father’s palace and he felt that it was now his duty to do something for him. So he decided to dismantle his previous residence and get his father’s mausoleum built on the same land. Since then, this well-favored edifice houses the tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. It was built in the area which was then called Khas Bazaar and is presently known as Qaiser Bagh. Khas Bazaar served as a market for the VIP’s, royal families and their foreign visitors. It’s really disheartening to see the present state of such a wondrous monument. It’s deteriorating condition in the form of crumbling plasters, broken pointed rod at it’s peak, dull-blackened walls and bad shape of the park surrounding it, is awaiting for the onlookers’s to pay heed over the feeling of love and respect with which it was once built and help it in regaining it’s original grace.\\nThe tombs of Saadat Ali Khan and Khurshid Zadi are grand in their own right, and visiting them can be a delightful experience. Both these tombs, which are one of the popular tourist attractions in Lucknow, are known for their intricate architecture and the garden surrounding them. Located in close proximity to the Begum Hazrat Mahal Park (built in 1962 to commemorate her contribution to the revolt of 1857), the tomb houses the 5th Nawab of Awadh, Saadat Ali Khan, and his wife, Khurshid Zadi. She was the favourite wife of the Nawab and died during his lifetime. Saadat Ali Khan was the ruler of Awadh from 1794-1814 AD, and many of the heritage buildings dotting the area between Qaisar Bagh and Dilkusha can be credited to him. During this time, the British ruled large parts of Lucknow and were becoming more powerful with each passing day. It is quite easy to overlook this wonderful memorial amidst other heritage buildings in the city like Chota Imambara and Bara Imambara. However, it is only upon visiting the tombs that you find out what you were missing out on.\\nArchitecture\\nThe tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan and Khurshid Zadi are counted among the best places to visit in Lucknow. Their architecture has a lot to do with that. While its facade is decorated with lime plaster, the walls are built using Lakhuri bricks (red colored burnt clay bricks) while sandstone has been used for the floors. Upon entering the tomb, you come across rectangular verandahs with intricately carved arched doorways. Of these, those on the southern and eastern side contain the graves of the daughters and wives of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. The floor of the tomb has also been given an elegant look, thanks to the black and white marble tiles laid out in a chess like pattern. Among the other features of the tomb, its hemispherical dome deserves a special mention. It attracts the attention of the onlookers with its symmetrical shape and is topped by an inverted lotus and a finial. In the center of the hall, there is an elegant rectangular design which marks the exact place where the tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan rests. Head towards the basement and you come across three graves, one of the Nawab and the other two of his brothers.\\nThe tomb of Khurshid Zadi is located to the east of the Nawab’s tomb. Although it is a four level structure, the graves of the mother and daughter rest at the lowest level. On the corners of the domes are octagonal shaped chhatris, which embellish its beauty. The tombs, which make for great sightseeing in Lucknow, are surrounded by beautiful gardens and are great for enjoying some moments of peace and solitude.\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

But because of the shortage of funds, the original ambition was curtailed. Despite constructed on a low budget, Jama Masjid has an unrivalled charm.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nLike most of the popular historical sites in Lucknow, Jama Masjid also boasts an impressive Mughal architecture. It is completely built of Lakhuri bricks and lime.

Along with that, various inscriptions can also be found on the walls of pillars. The tomb of Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah lies on the eastern side, whereas, the Imambara of Malika Jahan is also located on the western side of the mosque complex.\\r\\nLocation Address\\r\\nJama Masjid, Tehseenganj, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226004, India.\\r\\nVisiting Timings\\r\\nJama Masjid of Lucknow remains accessible all day a week.

There are many fascinating facts about it that make it a popular tourist attraction in Lucknow. One of them is that it is it was the first English church to be built in North India and the third in India. In fact, there was not a single church built between the years 1700 and 1819. Today, it intrigues onlookers and visitors with its elegant architecture, but also by the historical aura that pervades it. It is situated in the Hazratganj area. Although the church is not enormous in size, there is an old world feel to it that makes it special. However, you would not sense that until you actually enter its interiors and spend some time there. Visiting this church during your trip to Lucknow promises to be an informative and enlightening experience.\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nBefore you read a short history of Christ Church, you should also know something about the other churches in the country. The first church built in India by the Britishers was at Madras in the year 1680. It was known as St. Mary\\'s Church. This was followed by another church built in Kolkata in 1770 and known as St. John\\'s Church. It was only in 1810 that a church was built in Lucknow, thus becoming the third city in India with a church. At that time however, this church was known as St. Mary\\'s Church and it was built in the area known as British Residency.\\r\\nLike many other parts of the country, the church did not go unscated during the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, also known as the First Struggle for India\\'s Independence. It came under repeated attacks by the sepoys, with the worst attack carried out on 31st July and 5th August, 1857. It should be remembered however, that the attack was not motivated by any religious causes. It was attacked because the British used the church as a storage house for ammunition and weapons. Call it a stroke of luck or what you will, the church escaped being blown to smithereens by the British. During the next three years, while the church remained in a damaged state, the tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan and later the Sibtainabad Imambara served as places for Christian worship. Regular masses were also held at these religious places.\\r\\nIt is also interesting to know that for a short period of time, the gardens of the church were converted into a cemetery. The first people to be buried there were those that fell victims to the surprise attacks carried out by the Indian sepoys on 30th May, 1857.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nChrist Church is built in the Gothic style of architecture, just like most of the other churches across India. It is topped with twenty steeples, with a cross situated at the top of the entrance on the north. The church has an accommodation capacity of 130 persons at any given time. Observe its interiors though, and you will come across numerous marble tablets and polished brass plaques installed to honor the memory of British army officials, civilians and clergy who lost their lives in the conflict. These tablets are both a moving and impressive sight. One of the tablets is dedicated to James Grant Thomson, Deputy Commissioner of Muhamadee who lost his life fighting off the sepoys in Oudh on 5th June, 1857. Another of such tablets is dedicated to Revered Henry Polehampton. The church underwent extensive renovations and architectural modifications in 1904. The bell tower, which consists of a spire pointing towards the sky with a cross at the top, is a major eye turner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPopular Tourist Attractions Nearby\\r\\nBesides Christ Church, which is a major tourist attraction in Lucknow, there are other places that offer wonderful opportunities for sightseeing and exploration. Here are some of the other tourist places in Lucknow which you should definitely check out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSikandar Bagh\\r\\nThe Residency\\r\\nSt. Agnes Church\\r\\nRumi Darwaza\\r\\nAmbedkar Memorial Park\\r\\nNawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden\\r\\nJaneshwar Mishra Park\\r\\nNational Botanical Research Institute\\r\\nBara Imambara\\r\\nChota Imambara\\r\\n\\r\\nBest Time to Visit\\r\\nObviously, as a religious structure and holy place of worship, the Christ Church can be visited and is open throughout the year (subject the church timings of course). As far as the best time to visit the church goes, it depends on the kind of weather you are comfortable travelling in. During the summers, just like the rest of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow can get quite hot. The average temperature during this time is 42°C and can be a daunting factor for many people. If the heat and humidity doesn’t bother you much, go ahead and plan a trip during this time. It is during the winters though, that Lucknow receives cool and pleasant weather. Most tourists find the weather during this time to be quite agreeable and plan a trip during this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-Lalbagh Methodist Church Lucknow\\r\\n\\r\\nLalbagh Methodist Church Lucknow\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lal Bagh Methodical Church in Lucknow, built in the Gothic style of architecture, with its pointed vault and ribbed faults, is a picture of elegance with simplicity. It was William Butler who began English services in Lucknow, with the congregation being formed in 1870. Until 1972, except for a brief period from 1942-1944, all the pastors of the church were foreigners. It was only in 1974 that Indians were appointed as pastors of the church. Today, there were over 300 members in the church, including children.\\r\\nWhile there are other famous religious places to visit in Lucknow, you should visit this church for its historical significance and architecture, which combines grace with style. The altar faces the west direction while the main entrance door faces the eastern direction. The entrance has three doors, all of which are covered with a sloping portico. The northern part of the tower which faces out front is marked by a three storied tower.\\r\\nThe top portion of the tower is pointed and is mounted by a criss cross of steel. The middle portion of the roof is mounted by small crosses which present a lovely sight. Inside, facing the altar is a steel cross which is suspended in close proximity to the pulpit through a wire.\\r\\nBest Time to Visit Lal Bagh Methodical Church\\r\\nLabagh Methodist Church, as a religious structure, can be visited throughout the year. When it comes to the best time to visit it however, that\\'s a different issue altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n If you are comfortable travelling during summers, then by all means, visit it during this time. Remember though, that the average temperature during this time is around 42°C. A lot of tourists can find the temperature quite daunting. During the winters, the weather becomes cool and pleasant and creates the perfect conditions for sightseeing and exploration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-All Saints Garrison Church Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\nAll Saints Garrison Church Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the famous churches in India, or anywhere else in the world for that matter, have you ever heard of one which allowed people to carry weapons inside? All Saints Garrison Church, located in the Cantonment area of Lucknow, is one of them.\\r\\nBefore you jump to any conclusions, you should know how and why such a development came to take place, and the circumstances which led to it. As you enter the church, a sign greets you at the main door which reads, Whosoever thou art that enterest this church, leave it not without one Prayer to God for thyself, for those who minister, and for those who worship here.\\r\\nIt is a large impressive building to come across, one that is visible from quite a distance. At one point in time, it served as a church for those British residents who settled in the Cantonment area after escaping the British Residency when it was attacked by Indian sepoys. Even though it wears a forlorn look today, it does not fail to impress with its size and aesthetical elements. Stare at it from a distance for quite some time though, and you will feel a loneliness in the atmosphere, as if the church was yearning for the days gone by. Among the many churches to visit in Lucknow, this is one which you should not miss.\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nThough the All Saints Garrison Church impresses visitors with its size today, it wasn\\'t always so. It was first built in 1860, and was considerably smaller in terms of its size and proportions then. As time passed, however, the Lucknow Cantonment (the new settlement of the British after they had escaped the Residency) grew in size, as did the number of troops. Naturally, the need for a larger church was felt.\\r\\nAfter the construction of the new church was completed, it was named All Saints New Garrison Church. In fact, if you head towards the north west corner of the church about 15 to 20 feet away, you will come across a stone. The stone stands at the very same spot where the altar of the church was constructed in 1860.\\r\\nThe new church was built in 1908 by Jones Ransom, a British engineer who is also credited with having created the design for Saint Mungo\\'s Church of Scotland in the Cantonment area of Lucknow. Although he had made considerable progress with the construction of the church, he had to leave it midway and return to England. The work was then completed by Lishman who was supervised by the notable architect John Baggs.\\r\\nThe most interesting part of its history though, is the decision to allow guns inside its premises. It is commonly believed that during the Revolt of 1857, the Indian sepoys had entered the premises to attack the British and as a result, many had lost their lives. To avoid that tragedy, people were permitted to carry weapons inside during prayers.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nIn terms of architecture, the All Saints Garrison Church stands second to none. It is imposing, particularly its facade which is marked by an enormous tower. Even though the church was originally built by Jones Ransom, it underwent subsequent modifications under engineers who succeeded him. An example of this is the tower, which, in its original form, was meant to be taller than its present height. Another example is the side walls which were greatly reduced in both thickness and height, so as to save the overall expenses.\\r\\nHowever, even though its construction was largely influenced by considerations of money and expenses, it still manages to retain its elegance. When it comes to the seating capacity though, this church has a larger seating capacity than any other church in Lucknow. Its large space is also visible in the quadrangle, which has seating areas made of ply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the seating arrangements though, which strike the attention of the visitors and stand out as far as the architecture of the church is concerned. All the benches consist of a niche which was once used for keeping guns on the upper back side. This was done to enable the soldiers returning from their duties to participate in the prayers and other rituals while being in possession of their weapons.\\r\\nPopular Tourist Attractions Nearby\\r\\nLucknow is dotted with plenty of tourist places which offer great opportunities for sightseeing and exploration. After visiting All Saints Garrison Church, here are some of the other places which you can check out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Agnes Church\\r\\nChrist Church\\r\\nThe Residency\\r\\nSt. Agnes Church\\r\\nRumi Darwaza\\r\\nAmbedkar Memorial Park\\r\\nSikandar Bagh\\r\\nNawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden\\r\\nJaneshwar Mishra Park\\r\\nAssembly of God\\'s Church\\r\\nSt. Paul\\'s Church\\r\\nNational Botanical Research Institute\\r\\nBara Imambara\\r\\nChota Imambara\\r\\n\\r\\nBest Time to Visit\\r\\nAll Saints Garrison Church is a place of worship and can be visited throughout the year, subject to the timings of the church.

Others find the cool and pleasant weather during the winters to be perfect for a trip to Lucknow. You can also do the same if you prefer travelling in such weather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading:-Assembly of God\\'s Church Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\nAssembly of God\\'s Church Lucknow \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the subtleness of the structure of Assembly of God\\'s Church which strikes you at first sight. Then, its overall beauty gradually sinks in when you begin exploring it\\'s porch, entrance, grotto and pews. There is a subtlety which underlines every part of it. First timers will not face a lot of difficulty in reaching it. It is located in close proximity to Gomti Riverfront Park, one of the tourist attractions in Lucknow.\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nThe Assembly of God\\'s Church was blessed in 1862 by His Lordship, i.e. Bishop Hartmann. Details about it can be found in a book called \"Bishop Hartmann\" by Fr. Fulgentius O.F.Cap. In it he mentions two churches still under construction in 1860. One was the Cantonment Church (also known as St. Paul\\'s Church) and the other was the Chapel in the Civil Lines (also known as St. Joseph\\'s). These two churches also were still under construction when they were blessed by the Bishop. In the book, he also mentions that the Assembly of God\\'s Church was built by the government and was a part of Diocese of Lucknow and follows Roman Rite.\\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nThe first sight that catches your eyes upon arriving at Assembly of God\\'s Church in Lucknow is the grotto. It was erected on 1st January 1946 by the parishioners of St. Paul\\'s and external benefactors. The entrance door is marked by two confessionals on either sides. There is a beautiful ceiling along with wooden pews which are a feature common to every church.\\r\\nBest Time to Visit\\r\\nThe Assembly of God\\'s Church is located in Lucknow. The best time to visit it therefore, depends on the kind of weather you are comfortable travelling in. Come summers, and the heat can be unrelenting. The average temperature during this season hovers around 42°C and can be daunting for tourists. If you are comfortable with hot weather conditions, you can visit it during this time.

William Gleeson, who arrived from Golaganj to Hazratganj. He did this partly by selling a piece of land of a former mission at Golabganj, and partly by with the proceeds and subscriptions raised from the public. The construction of the church was completed in 1862, after which it was blessed by Bishop Anastasius Hartmann. \\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nWithout a doubt, it is the architecture of St. Joseph\\'s Church in Lucknow which makes it stand out from the others.

From being laid out by Lord Lakshmana to being governed by Mughal rulers to serving as the administrative capital at the time of the British Raj to being the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the city has seen it all. It has proudly maintained its reputation as a city of culture, gracious living, rich cuisine, and beauty throughout.\\nLucknow appears to be a straightforward and uncomplicated city.\\nSince the dawn of time, Lucknow\\'s \"Chikankaari\" has been an inseparable part of Indian culture. The perfume of Lucknow\\'s rich culture and refinement is carried by the natural \"Itra.\" When in Lucknow, both of these are a must-have.\\nThe city will gladly take your hand and show you its past and present. The city is dotted with Mughal and British Raj-era structures and tombs like the Residency, Bara Imambara, Rumi Darwaza, and Jama Masjid, to mention a few. Visiting Bhool Bhullaiya is a must-do when in Lucknow. It\\'s a maze of hundreds of small stairwell passageways, some of which lead to dead ends that were built to throw invaders off. It\\'s one of the most enigmatic sites. From here, one may take a \"Tanga ride\" to Chhota Imambara.\\n#Trivia: Lucknowites would frequently exclaim, \"Yahan par sab nawab hain!\" and there is no better way to convey the soul of the city than this. It denotes that every Lucknowite is a nawab, and visitors to the city will undoubtedly be greeted and treated as Nawaabs too.\\nTop Places to Visit in Lucknow\\n01. Rumi Darwaza\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t even need to get out of your Rickshaw to see one of Lucknow\\'s most popular attractions. The Rumi Darwaza is a colossal entry gate to the city, and it\\'s a much-loved and fascinating monument in the heart of Lucknow. Vehicles pass through it as they navigate through the bustle of the large lanes in the old city.\\nThe Lucknow Rumi Darwaza is one of India\\'s most spectacular buildings. It was established in 1784 by Nawab Asaf-ud-daula as part of his \\'Food for Work\\' initiative to aid the city\\'s people in surviving a devastating drought.\\nThe gateway, which rises 60 feet tall and is covered with artistically carved flowers and motifs, was completed in the same year. It was modelled after richly artistic gateway styles prevalent in Constantinople (now Istanbul).\\nLike the Bara Imambara\\'s arch (to the west of Rumi Darwaza), this construction lacks any additional wood or iron fittings to support it from the exterior, but it still stands. A tower area on top of the structure previously housed a large lantern used to illuminate the tower at night. This is a magnificent specimen of Awadhi architecture that is definitely worth seeing.\\n02. Bara Imambara\\n\\n\\nThe Bara Imambara, a massive and expansive edifice famed for its labyrinth and elaborate features, was the most stunning and striking building in Lucknow. In 1784, Asaf-ud-Daula built this as a part of a famine relief effort and was known to be one of Lucknow\\'s earliest attempts to recreate the form of Mughal grandeur. This is one of Lucknow\\'s rare structures without any European influences.\\nThe Imambara is built in a unique way, and there was no use of wood or metal in the construction of this mosque. It is a significant place of devotion for Muslims, who visit each year to commemorate the holy festival of Muharram. Bara Imambara is a wonder of engineering and a remarkable example of Mughal architecture. It is said to be the world\\'s biggest building that is not supported by any beams.\\nThe burial of Nawab Asaf-Ud-Dowlah and his crown is also on display in the centre hall, which is claimed to be the world\\'s biggest vaulted room. The Imambara is well renowned for its marvellous maze, called Bhul Bhulaiya, situated on the upper floor of the monument.\\n#Trivia: Legend has it that there are 1024 ways to enter the maze but only two ways out. If you make it to the top, you\\'ll be rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the city.\\nOpening hours: 9:00 AM-5:00 PM\\n      Entry Fees: Rs. 50 for Indians, Rs. 500 for Foreigners\\n03. Chota Imambara\\n\\n\\nMuhammad Ali Shah was the third Nawab of Awadh, who erected the grand historical edifice of Chota Imambara in 1838. It was initially intended to serve as a gathering place for Shia Muslims. However, the site subsequently became the mausoleum for both the Nawab and his mother. Chota Imambara is a realm of luxury, with European chandeliers, a really amazing Hammam, and miniature Taj Mahals. The exteriors include exquisite Islamic calligraphy, which adds to the aesthetic attractiveness.\\nIt\\'s a lovely fusion of Charbagh, Indo-Islamic, and Persian design and construction styles.

This beautiful temple was built by the wife of Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah, Begum Rabiya. If you think this fact makes it one of the most incredible places to visit in Lucknow, wait till you hear the story behind its construction.\\r\\nIt is believed that the Begum had a dream in which she came across an idol of Lord Hanuman hidden inside a particular spot in a garden. An unknown voice then advised her to dig the idol out and install it in the temple. Nobody knew who, how, and if, anybody placed it there.  It was not long afterwards that she was blessed with a child. Convinced that there was a divine hand at play behind these events, the Nawab ordered the construction of a temple in close proximity to Bara Imambara with the statue inside it. It is this temple which is known as the Purana Hanuman Mandir, or the Old Hanuman Temple. \\r\\nThe other famous temple, which is called the Naya Hanuman Mandir, or New Hanuman Temple, was built in 1752 AD, and is therefore, almost 30 years old. This temple was built by Jathmal, a commander in Alia Begum’s army. The idol of Lord Hanuman, which was housed in the Old Hanuman Mandir, was now sought to be installed at some other place. What happened thereafter was even more surprising. Everybody was taken aback and amazed when the elephant carrying the statue to the temple stopped in its tracks, sat down, and refused to even budge an inch further. Repeated efforts to get it going again proved completely futile. Matters came to a standstill until a saint intervened and suggested the construction of a temple at that very place. Thereafter, not only was the temple built, but a plot of land was also granted for its maintenance.\\r\\nThe temple, which is one of the most visited tourist places in Lucknow, is also famous for hosting the Bada Mangal festival. The festival is unique because it is celebrated only in Lucknow and reflects the wonderful synthetic culture of the region. Devotees from all over the state as well as different parts of the country flock to the temple to participate in the festival. It is celebrated on the first Tuesday of the Jyeshtha month, which in the Gregorian calendar, are the months of May and June. On the eve of the festival, the gates of the sanctum sanctorum are closed for visitors. During this time, various rituals like bathing, clothing and make-up are performed on the statue of Lord Hanuman. Finally, the doors are opened for devotees a few hours before midnight and remain open for the early hours of the day. \\r\\nArchitecture\\r\\nThe architecture of Purana Hanuman Temple suggests an amalgamation of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles. One place in the temple which reflects this style rather strongly is its tomb, which is topped by a moon, a feature usually found in mosques. It is a reminder of the spirit of tolerance, love and brotherhood which has prevailed in this region since ages. The temple premises also house a pond as well as a garden. The pillars of the temple, painted in saffron, enhance its overall aesthetic appeal. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from Lord Hanuman, which is the main deity, the temple also houses the statues of Nandi Bull and Lord Ganesh. The hall inside the temple is very spacious and is meant to accommodate a large number of devotees. Its walls are adorned with murals of various gods and goddesses. The Naya Hanuman Mandir is also as the beautiful as the old one. Its entrance is guarded by two statues dressed in traditional attire. A flight of stairs take you to the main gate of the temple, which then opens to a medium sized courtyard.

[14][15]Lucknow region is emerging as a key industrial and logistics hub in North India after Delhi-NCR as the warehousing sector.[16] Lucknow is the administrative headquarters of the eponymous district and division. Having a population of 2.8 million as per 2011 census, it is the eleventh most populous city and the twelfth-most populous urban agglomeration of India. Lucknow has always been a multicultural city that flourished as a North Indian cultural and artistic hub, and the seat of power of Nawabs in the 18th and 19th centuries.[17] It is the most important center of Shia Islam in the Indian Subcontinent and has influence of Persian, Shiite, Arabic and British culture and tradition in the architecture, language and customs. It continues to be an important centre of governance, administration, education, commerce, aerospace, finance, pharmaceuticals, information technology, design, culture, tourism, music, and poetry.[18][19][20]\\n\\nLucknow stands at an elevation of approximately 123 metres (404 ft) above sea level. The city had an area of 402 km2 (155 square miles) until December 2019, when 88 villages were added to the municipal limits and the area increased to 631 km2 (244 square miles).[21] Bounded on the east by Barabanki, on the west by Unnao, on the south by Raebareli and in the north by Sitapur and Hardoi, Lucknow sits on the northwestern shore of the Gomti River. As of 2008, there were 110 wards in the city. Morphologically, three clear demarcations exist: The central business district, which is a fully built up area, comprises Hazratganj, Aminabad and Chowk. A middle zone surrounds the inner zone with concrete houses while the outer zone consists of villages.[22]\\n\\nHistorically, Lucknow was the capital of the Awadh region, controlled by the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire. It was transferred to the Nawabs of Awadh. In 1856, the British East India Company abolished local rule and took complete control of the city along with the rest of Awadh and, in 1857, transferred it to the British Raj.[23] Along with the rest of India, Lucknow became independent from Britain on 15 August 1947. It has been listed as the 17th-fastest growing city in India and 74th in the world.[24]\\n\\nLucknow, along with Agra and Varanasi, is in the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a chain of survey triangulations created by the Government of Uttar Pradesh to boost tourism in the state.\\n\"Lucknow\" is the anglicised spelling of the local pronunciation \"Lakhnau\". According to one legend, the city is named after Lakshmana, a hero of the Hindu epic Ramayana. The legend states that Lakshmana had a palace or an estate in the area, which was called Lakshmanapuri (Sanskrit: लक्ष्मणपुरी, lit. Lakshmana\\'s city). The settlement came to be known as Lakhanpur (or Lachhmanpur) by the 11th century, and later, Lucknow.[25][26]\\n\\nA similar theory states that the city was known as Lakshmanavati (Sanskrit: लक्ष्मणवती, fortunate) after Lakshmana. The name changed to Lakhanavati, then Lakhnauti and finally Lakhnau.[27] Yet another theory states that the city\\'s name is connected with Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth. Over time, the name changed to Laksmanauti, Laksmnaut, Lakhsnaut, Lakhsnau and, finally, Lakhnau.[28]\\n\\nAnother theory is that Lucknow was named after a very influential architect named Lakhna Ahir, who built the fort Qila Lakhna.[29][30]\\n\\nFrom 1350 onwards, Lucknow and parts of the Awadh region were ruled by the Delhi Sultanate, Sharqi Sultanate, Mughal Empire, Nawabs of Awadh, the British East India Company and the British Raj.\\n\\nFor about eighty-four years (from 1394 to 1478), Awadh was part of the Sharqi Sultanate of Jaunpur. Emperor Humayun made it a part of the Mughal Empire around 1555. Emperor Jahangir (1569–1627) granted an estate in Awadh to a favoured nobleman, Sheikh Abdul Rahim, who later built Machchi Bhawan on this estate. It later became the seat of power from where his descendants, the Sheikhzadas, controlled the region.[31]\\n\\n\\nA Muslim woman of rank from Lucknow, early 19th century\\nThe Nawabs of Lucknow, in reality, the Nawabs of Awadh, acquired the name after the reign of the third Nawab when Lucknow became their capital. The city became North India\\'s cultural capital, and its nawabs, best remembered for their refined and extravagant lifestyles, were patrons of the arts. Under their dominion, music and dance flourished, and construction of numerous monuments took place.[32] Of the monuments standing today, the Bara Imambara, the Chota Imambara, and the Rumi Darwaza are notable examples. One of the Nawab\\'s enduring legacies is the region\\'s syncretic Hindu–Muslim culture that has come to be known as the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb.[33]\\n\\n\\nGates of the Palace at Lucknow by W. Daniell, 1801\\n\\nChota Imambara is a Shia Muslim Hussainiya and a mausoleum for Muhammad Ali Shah.\\nUntil 1719, the subah of Awadh was a province of the Mughal Empire administered by a governor appointed by the emperor. Persian adventurer Saadat Khan, also known as Burhan-ul-Mulk, was appointed Nizam of Awadh in 1722 and established his court in Faizabad, near Lucknow.[34]\\nMany independent kingdoms, such as Awadh, were established as the Mughal Empire disintegrated. The third Nawab, Shuja-ud-Daula (r. 1753–1775), fell out with the British after aiding the fugitive Nawab of Bengal, Mir Qasim. Roundly defeated at the Battle of Buxar by the East India Company, he was forced to pay heavy penalties and surrender parts of his territory.[35] Awadh\\'s capital, Lucknow rose to prominence when Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab, shifted his court to the city from Faizabad in 1775.[36] The British East India Company appointed a resident (ambassador) in 1773 and by early 19th century gained control of more territory and authority in the state. They were, however, disinclined to capture Awadh outright and come face to face with the Maratha Empire and the remnants of the Mughal Empire. In 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan alienated both his people and the British and was forced to abdicate. The British then helped Saadat Ali Khan take the throne.[37] He became a puppet king, and in a treaty of 1801, yielded large part of Awadh to the East India Company while also agreeing to disband his own troops in favour of a hugely expensive, British-controlled army. This treaty effectively made the state of Awadh a vassal of the East India Company, although it continued to be part of the Mughal Empire in name until 1819. The treaty of 1801 proved a beneficial arrangement for the East India Company as they gained access to Awadh\\'s vast treasuries, repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. In addition, the revenues from running Awadh\\'s armed forces brought them useful returns while the territory acted as a buffer state. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with pomp and show. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the British had grown impatient with the arrangement and demanded direct control over Awadh.[38]\\n\\n\\nThe ruins of the Residency at Lucknow show evidence of the gunfire sustained during the rebellion.\\n\\nBada Imambada is famous for its maze called \\'Bhool Bhulaiyaa\\' in Hindi-Urdu. It is built of identical 75-centimetre-wide (2.5 ft) passageways like the one shown in this photograph.\\nIn 1856, the East India Company first moved its troops to the border, then annexed the state for alleged maladministration. Awadh was placed under a chief commissioner – Sir Henry Lawrence. Wajid Ali Shah, the then Nawab, was imprisoned, then exiled by the East India Company to Calcutta.[39] In the subsequent Indian Rebellion of 1857, his 14-year-old son Birjis Qadra, whose mother was Begum Hazrat Mahal, was crowned ruler. Following the rebellion\\'s defeat, Begum Hazrat Mahal and other rebel leaders sought asylum in Nepal.[40]\\nLucknow was one of the major centres of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and actively participated in India\\'s independence movement, emerging as a strategically important North Indian city. During the Rebellion (also known as the First War of Indian Independence and the Indian Mutiny), the majority of the East India Company\\'s troops were recruited from both the people and nobility of Awadh. The rebels seized control of the state, and it took the British 18 months to reconquer the region. During that period, the garrison based at the Residency in Lucknow was besieged by rebel forces during the Siege of Lucknow. The siege was relieved first by forces under the command of Sir Henry Havelock and Sir James Outram, followed by a stronger force under Sir Colin Campbell. Today, the ruins of the Residency and the Shaheed Smarak offer an insight into Lucknow\\'s role in the events of 1857.[41]\\n\\nWith the rebellion over, Oudh returned to British governance under a chief commissioner. In 1877, the offices of lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces and chief commissioner of Oudh were combined; then in 1902, the title of chief commissioner was dropped with the formation of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, although Oudh still retained some marks of its former independence.[42]\\n\\n\\nThe Khilafat Movement had an active base of support in Lucknow, creating united opposition to British rule. In 1901, after remaining the capital of Oudh since 1775, Lucknow, with a population of 264,049, was merged into the newly formed United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.[43] In 1920, the provincial seat of government moved from Allahabad to Lucknow. Upon Indian independence in 1947, the United Provinces were reorganised into the state of Uttar Pradesh, and Lucknow remained its capital.[44]\\n\\nLucknow witnessed some of the pivotal moments in the history of India. One is the first meeting of the stalwarts Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohd Ali Jinnah during the Indian National Congress session of 1916 (the Lucknow pact was signed and moderates and extremists came together through the efforts of Annie Besant during this session only). The Congress President for that session, Ambica Charan Majumdar in his address said that \"If the Congress was buried at Surat, it is reborn in Lucknow in the garden of Wajid Ali Shah.\"\\n\\nThe Kakori conspiracy involving Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Rajendra Nath Lahiri, Roshan Singh and others, followed by the Kakori trial which captured the imagination of the country, also took place in Lucknow.[45]\\n\\nCulturally, Lucknow has also had a tradition of courtesans,[46] with popular culture distilling it in the avatar of the fictional Umrao Jaan.\\nThe Gomti River, Lucknow\\'s chief geographical feature, meanders through the city and divides it into the Trans-Gomti and Cis-Gomti regions. Situated in the middle of the Indus-Gangetic Plain, the city is surrounded by rural towns and villages: the orchard town of Malihabad, Kakori, Mohanlalganj, Gosainganj, Chinhat and Itaunja. To the east lies Barabanki, to the west Unnao, to the south Raebareli, while to the north lie the Sitapur and Hardoi. Lucknow city is located in a seismic zone III.[47]\\n\\nFurther information: Cis-Gomti area\\nClimate\\nLucknow has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) with cool, dry winters from mid-November to February and dry, hot summers with sunshine from March to mid-May. More than nine-tenths of the annual rainfall occurs from June to October when the city receives an average of 827.2 millimetres (32.57 in) from the southwest monsoon winds, although occasionally frontal rainfall from the northeast monsoon will occur in January. In winter the maximum temperature is around 25 °C or 77 °F and the minimum is in the 3 to 7 °C (37.4 to 44.6 °F) range.[48] Fog is quite common from mid-December to late January. Occasionally, Lucknow experiences colder winter spells than places like Shimla and Mussoorie which are situated way high up in the Himalayas. In the extraordinary winter cold spell of 2012–2013, Lucknow recorded temperatures below freezing point on two consecutive days and the minimum temperature hovered around freezing point for over a week.[citation needed] Summers are very hot with temperatures rising into the 40 to 45 °C (104 to 113 °F) range, the average maxima being in the high 30s Celsius.\\n\\nLucknow has a total of 5.66 per cent of forest cover, the state average being around 7 per cent.[53] Native tree species are: shisham, dhak, mahuamm, babul, neem, peepal, ashok, khajur, mango and gular.[54]\\n\\nSeveral varieties of mangoes, especially Dasheri, are grown in the Malihabad adjacent to the city and a block of the Lucknow district for export.[55] The main crops are wheat, paddy, sugarcane, mustard, potatoes, and vegetables such as cauliflower, cabbage, tomato and brinjal. Similarly, sunflowers, roses, and marigolds are cultivated over a fairly extensive area. Many medicinal and herbal plants are grown, while common Indian monkeys are found in patches in and around city forests such as Musa Bagh.[56]\\n\\nEstablished in 1921, the Lucknow Zoo is one of the oldest in the country. It houses a rich collection of animals from Asia, and other continents. The zoo also has enjoyable toy train rides for visitors. The city has a botanical garden, which is a zone of wide botanical diversity.[57] It is home to the Uttar Pradesh State Museum, which has sculptural masterpieces dating back to the 3rd century AD, including intricately carved Mathura sculptures ranging from dancing girls to scenes from the life of Buddha.[58]\\nThe major industries in the Lucknow urban agglomeration include aeronautics, automotive, machine tools, distillery chemicals, furniture and Chikan embroidery.[59] Lucknow is among the top cities of India by GDP.[60] It is a centre for research and development as home to the R&D centres of the National Milk Grid of the National Dairy Development Board, the Central Institute of Medical and Aromatic Plants, the National Handloom Development Corporation and U.P. Export Corporation.[61] Lucknow is ranked sixth in a list of the ten fastest growing job-creating cities in India according to a study conducted by Assocham Placement Pattern,[62] Lucknow\\'s economy was formerly based on the tertiary sector and the majority of the workforce were employed as government servants. Large-scale industrial establishments are few compared to other northern Indian state capitals like New Delhi. The economy is growing with contributions from the fields of IT, manufacturing and processing and medical/biotechnology. Business-promoting institutions such as the CII have set up their service centres in the city.[63] Major export items are marbled products, handicrafts, art pieces, gems, jewellery, textiles, electronics, software products, computers, hardware products, apparel, brass products, silk, leather goods, glass items and chemicals. Lucknow has promoted public-private partnerships in sectors such as electricity supply, roads, expressways, and educational ventures.[64]\\n\\nLucknow in recent times have lagged in growth and only ranks 7th in per capita income in the state of Uttar Pradesh, despite being the capital. Cities like Noida, Ghaziabad and Meerut have dominated in terms of industrial growth and attracting IT jobs and opportunities. Noida ranks highest, followed by Meerut in per capita income in the state.[65]\\n\\nMultiple software and IT companies are present in the city. Tata Consultancy Services, HCL Technologies are present in the city. IT companies are located in Gomtinagar.[66] While it still lags behind cities like Noida, Greater Noida and Meerut in IT hubs. There are many local open source technology companies.[67] The city is also home to a number of important national and state level headquarters for companies including Sony Corporation and Reliance Retail.[68] The handicrafts sector accounts for 60 per cent of total exports from the state.[69]\\n\\nCompanies such as Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, KARAM, Tata Marcopolo, Exide Industries, Tata Motors set up their plants in Lucknow. Lucknow is an emerging automobile hub. Tata Motors have a plant primarily for light commercial vehicles. It was set up in 1992 and has a production capacity of 640 vehicles per day.[70][71] Additionally there is a plant of Tata Marcopolo in the city.\\n\\nTo promote the textile industry in the city, the Indian government has allocated Rs. 2 billion (2000 million rupees) to set up a textile business cluster in the city.[72] A sprawling 40 hectares (0.40 km2; 100 acres) IT city costing 15 billion Rupees is planned by the state government at the Chak Ganjaria farms site on the road to Sultanpur and they have already approved special economic zone status for the project, which is expected to create thousands of job opportunities in the state.[73][74] A defence industrial corridor is also coming in the city.[75]\\n\\nTraditionally, Lucknow has been a mandi town for mangoes, melons, and grains grown in the surrounding areas.[citation needed] Sugarcane-growing plantations and sugar industries are also in close proximity. This attracted Edward Dyer to set up a unit based on molasses in the city. Dyer Breweries was incorporated in 1855 and was Asia\\'s first commercial brewery. The company name was changed to Mohan Meakin Brewery in 1967 (the word \"Breweries\" was dropped in the eighties as the company diversified into other industries).[76]\\n\\nLucknow is famous for its small scale industries that are based on unique styles of embroidery, namely, Chikan and Lakhnawi Zardozi, both of which are significant foreign exchange earners. Chikan has caught the fancy of fashion designers in Bollywood and abroad.[citation needed] It is very popular in Indian markets and have very high demand.\\nDuring the period of the Nawabs, kite-making reached a high level of artistry,[77] and is still a small-scale industry.\\nThe Ministry of Communications and Information Technology set up Software Technology Parks of India[78] in 2001. Currently, biotechnology and information technology are the two focus areas to promote economic development in and around the city.[citation needed] The Ministry of Science and Technology is setting up a biotech park[79] in the city. Lucknow is also one of the selected cities for the Smart City project of STPI.\\n\\nGeneral administration\\nLucknow division which consists of six districts, and is headed by the Divisional Commissioner of Lucknow, who is an IAS officer of high seniority, the Commissioner is the head of local government institutions (including municipal corporations) in the division, is in charge of infrastructure development in his division, and is also responsible for maintaining law and order in the division.[80][81][82][83][84] The District Magistrate of Lucknow reports to the divisional commissioner. The current commissioner is Mukesh Meshram.[85][86]\\n\\nLucknow district administration is headed by the District Magistrate of Lucknow, who is an IAS officer. The DM is in charge of property records and revenue collection for the central government and oversees the elections held in the city. The district has five tehsils, viz. Sadar, Mohanlalganj, Bakshi ka Talab, Malihabad and Sarojini Nagar, each headed by a Sub-Divisional Magistrate.[87] The current DM is Abhishek Prakash.[85][86][87] The district magistrate is assisted by a Chief Development Officer (CDO), eight Additional District Magistrates (ADM) (Finance/Revenue, East, West Trans-Gomti, Executive, Land Acquisition-I, Land Acquisition-II, Civil Supply), one City Magistrate (CM) and seven Additional City Magistrates (ACM).[87]\\n\\nCivic administration\\nThe Lucknow Municipal Corporation oversees civic activities in the city. The city\\'s first municipal body dates from 1862 when the municipal board was established.[88] The first Indian mayor, Syed Nabiullah, was elected in 1917 after the enforcement of the UP Municipalities Act, 1916. In 1948, the Uttar Pradesh government changed the system from an electoral one to an administrator-run one and Bhairav Datt Sanwal became the administrator. In 1959, the UP Municipalities Act, 1916 was replaced with Uttar Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1959 and Lucknow Municipal Corporation was established in 1960 with Raj Kumar Shrivastava becoming the mayor.[89]\\n\\nThe head of the corporation is the mayor, but the executive and administration of the corporation are the responsibility of the municipal commissioner, who is an Uttar Pradesh government-appointed Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer of high seniority. The last municipal election took place in 2017 when Sanyukta Bhatia from Bharatiya Janata Party became the first female mayor of Lucknow.[90] Bharatiya Janata Party won 57 councillor seats, Samajwadi Party won 31 seats, independent candidates won 14 seats, and Indian National Congress won 8 seats.[91] Ajay Kumar Dwivedi, an IAS officer, is the present municipal commissioner since 17 August 2020.[92] The Uttar Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1959 gives provisions for the establishment of ward committees, but they have not been formed yet.[93]\\n\\nThe sources for revenue generation for Lucknow Municipal Corporation include property tax, user charges for SWM, penalties, rent from municipal properties, income from water storage, water transmission, drainage and sanitation, grants, and charges for services such as birth and death certificates.[94][95] There is also an executive committee (कार्यकारिणी समिति) made up of 12 elected councillors from different political parties, who decide on policy matters of the corporation.[96]\\n\\nPolice administration\\nSee also: Lucknow City Police\\nThe Police Commissionerate System was introduced in Lucknow on 14 January 2020. The district police is headed by a Commissioner of Police (CP), who is an IPS officer of ADGP rank and is assisted by two Joint Commissioners of Police (IG rank), and five Deputy Commissioners of Police (SP rank). Lucknow is divided into five zones, each headed by a Deputy Commissioner of Police. Of the two Joint Commissioners, one looks after law and order, the other crime. The current police commissioner of Lucknow City is IPS SB Shirodkar.[97]\\n\\nThe district police observes the citizenry through high-technology control rooms and all important streets and intersections are under surveillance with the help of CCTVs and drone cameras.[98] Crowd-control is carried out with the help of pepper-spraying drones.[99] There are more than 10,000 CCTV cameras deployed by the Lucknow Police Department across the city roads and trijunctions, making Lucknow the first city in the country to do so.[100]\\n\\nThe Lucknow Modern Police Control Room (abbreviated as MCR) is India\\'s biggest \\'Dial 112\\' service centre with 300 communication officers to receive distress calls from all over the state and 200 dispatch officers to rush for police help.[101] It is billed as the India\\'s most hi-tech police control room.[102] Lucknow is also the center for 1090 Women Power line, a call center based service directed at dealing with eve-teasing. An Integrated \\'Dial 112\\' Control Room building is also there which is having the world\\'s biggest modern Police Emergency Response System (PERS).[103]\\n\\nJudicial institutions\\nThere is a bench of the Allahabad High Court in Lucknow. Aside from this, Lucknow has a District & Sessions Court, five CBI Courts, one family court and two railway courts. The High Court Bench as well as the District & Sessions Court and the CBI courts are located in Qaiser Bagh, and the railway courts are in Charbagh.[104]\\n\\nPeople have often criticised various governments for being judicial focussed on central UP. Where western Uttar Pradesh is the economic center and has long demanded the setting up of another high court bench in west Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nAlmost 54% of all cases reaching the High Court originate from the 22 districts of Western UP. Still, western Uttar Pradesh does not have a High Court. People have to travel 700 km away to Allahabad for hearings. In fact 6 high courts (Shimla, Delhi, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Nainital, Jammu) from other states are closer than Allahabad from western Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nWestern Uttar Pradesh has been advocating to have a high court bench in Meerut so that Western Uttar Pradesh can get justice. This is important as west UP accounts for 51.71% of the state GDP. [105]\\n\\n\\nSince 1 May 1963, Lucknow has been the headquarters of the Central Command of the Indian Army, before which it was the headquarters of Eastern Command.[106]\\n\\nLucknow also houses a branch office of National Investigation Agency which is responsible for combating terrorist activities in India.[107] It oversees five states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh for Naxal and terrorist activities.[108]\\n\\nThe Commission of Railway Safety of India, under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, has its head office in the Northeast Railway Compound in Lucknow.[109]\\n\\nInfrastructure\\nThe development of infrastructure in the city is overseen by Lucknow Development Authority (LDA), which comes under the Housing Department of Uttar Pradesh government. The Divisional Commissioner of Lucknow acts as the ex-officio chairman of LDA, whereas a vice-chairman, a government-appointed IAS officer, looks after the daily matters of the authority. The current vice-chairman of the Lucknow Development Authority is IAS Akshay Tripathi.[110][111] LDA prepared the Lucknow master plan 2031.[112]\\n\\nPolitics\\nAs the seat of the government of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow is the site of the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha, a bench of the Allahabad High Court and numerous government departments and agencies.[113] Rajnath Singh, the Union Defense Minister, from Bharatiya Janata Party is the Member of Parliament from Lucknow Lok Sabha Constituency.[114] Kaushal Kishore[115] is the Member of Parliament from Mohanlalganj (Lok Sabha constituency), the second Lok Sabha constituency in Lucknow.[116] Apart from the Lok Sabha Constituency, there are nine Vidhan Sabha Constituencies within Lucknow city:[117][118]\\n\\nPublic utilities\\nMadhyanchal Power Distribution Corporation Limited, also known as Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam is responsible for supplying electricity in Lucknow. It is under the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd.[121][122] Fire safety services are provided by the Uttar Pradesh Fire Service, which is under the state government.[123] Jal Nigam is responsible for developing and maintaining the infrastructure for water supply, sewer lines, and storm water drains.[124] Jal Sansthan is responsible for supplying water and providing water and sewer connections.[125] Lucknow Municipal Corporation is responsible for the solid waste management of Lucknow.[126]\\n\\nTwo major Indian National Highways have their intersection at Lucknow\\'s Hazratganj intersection: NH-30 to Shahjahanpur Via Sitapur in north and NH-30 to south Allahabad via Raebareli, NH-27 to Kanpur and Porbandar via Jhansi and Silchar via Gorakhpur.[127] Multiple modes of public transport are available such as metro rail, taxis, city buses, cycle rickshaws, auto rickshaws and compressed natural gas (CNG) low-floor buses with and without air-conditioning. CNG was introduced as an auto fuel to keep air pollution under control. Radio Taxis are operated by several major companies like Ola and Uber.\\n\\nFurther information on the road and street: Subhash Marg and Mahatma Gandhi Marg\\n\\nLucknow city\\'s bus service is operated by Lucknow City Transport Services Limited (LCTSL), a public sector passenger road transport corporation headquartered in Triloki Nath Margh. It has 260 buses operating in the city. There are around 35 routes in the city.[128] Terminals for city buses are located in Gudamba, Viraj Khand, Alambagh, Scooter India, Institute of Engineering and Technology, Babu Banarasi Das University, Safedabad, Pasi qila, Charbagh, Andhe Ki Chowki, Jankipuram, Gomti Nagar Railway Station, Budheshwar Intersection, Faizabad Road and Qaiserbagh. There are four bus depots in Gomti Nagar, Charbagh, Amausi, and Dubagga.[129]\\n\\nInter-state buses\\nSee also: Kanpur Lucknow Roadways Service and Lucknow Upnagariya Parivahan Sewa\\nThe major Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Inter-state Bus Terminal (ISBT) in Alambagh provides the main inter and intrastate bus lines in Lucknow. Located on National Highway 25, it provides adequate services to ongoing and incoming customers. There is a smaller bus station at Qaiserbagh. The bus terminal formally operated at Charbagh, in front of the main railway station, has now been re-established as a city bus depot. This decision was taken by the state government and UPSRTC to decongest traffic in the railway station area. Kanpur Lucknow Roadways Service is a key service for daily commuters who travel back and forth to the city for business and educational purposes. Air conditioned \"Royal Cruiser\" buses manufactured by Volvo are operated by UPSRTC for inter state bus services. Main cities served by the UPSRTC intrastate bus service are Allahabad, Varanasi, Jaipur, Jhansi, Agra, Delhi, Gorakhpur. The cities outside Uttar Pradesh that are covered by inter-state bus services are Jaipur, New Delhi, Kota, Singrauli, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Dausa, Ajmer, Dehradun, and Haridwar.[130]\\n\\nLucknow is served by several railway stations in different parts of the city. The main long-distance railway station is Lucknow Railway Station located at Charbagh. It has an imposing structure built in 1923 and acts as the divisional headquarters of the Northern Railway division. Its neighbouring and second major long-distance railway station is Lucknow Junction railway station operated by the North Eastern Railway. The city is an important junction with links to all major cities of the state and country such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Nashik, Amritsar, Jammu, Chennai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Pune, Indore, Bhopal, Jhansi, Jabalpur, Jaipur, Raipur and Siwan. The city has a total of fourteen railway stations.[129] Earlier the meter-gauge services originated at Aishbagh and connected to Lucknow city, Daliganj and Mohibullapur. Now all the stations have been converted to broad gauge. All stations lie within the city limits and are well interconnected by bus services and other public road transport. Suburban stations include Bakshi Ka Talab and Kakori. The Lucknow–Kanpur Suburban Railway was started in 1867 to cater for the needs of commuters travelling between Lucknow and Kanpur. Trains running on this service also stop at numerous stations at different locations in the city forming a suburban rail network.[130]\\n\\nLucknow is served by Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport. The airport has been ranked the second-best in the world in the small airport category.[131] The airport is suitable for all-weather operations and provides parking facilities for up to 14 aircraft. Covering 480 hectares (4.80 km2; 1,187 acres), with Terminal 1 for international flights and Terminal 2 for domestic flights, the airport can handle Boeing 767 to Boeing 747-400 aircraft allowing significant passenger and cargo traffic.[132][133] International destinations include Dubai, Muscat, Sharjah, Riyadh, Bangkok, Dammam and Jeddah.[134]\\n\\nThe planned expansion of the airport will allow Airbus A380 jumbo jets to land at the airport. The Nagarjuna construction company (NCC) has started the construction of the new terminal at Lucknow Airport which is expected to be completed by December 2021 to meet the growing demand.[135] There is also a plan for runway expansion. The airport is the eleventh busiest airport in India, the busiest in Uttar Pradesh, and the second-busiest in northern India.\\n\\nLucknow Metro is a rapid transit system which started its operations from 6 September 2017. Lucknow Metro system is the most-quickly built metro system in the world[136] and most economical high-speed rapid transit system project in India.[137] The commencement of civil works started on 27 September 2014.[138]\\n\\nLucknow has the third largest metro network in the state after Noida, Meerut and Ghaziabad.\\n\\nIn February, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav approved to set up of a metro rail system for the state capital. It is divided into two corridors the north–south corridor connecting Munshipulia to CCS International Airport and the east–west corridor connecting Charbagh Railway Station to Vasant Kunj. This will be the most expensive public transport system in the state but will provide a rapid means of mass transport to decongest traffic on city roads. Construction of the first phase will be complete by March 2017. The completion of metro rail project is the primary object of Uttar Pradesh government currently headed by the chief minister Yogi Adityanath[139]\\n\\nOn 5 September 2017, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and CM Yogi Adityanath showed green flag to the Lucknow Metro.[140]\\n\\nCycling\\nLucknow is among the most bicycle-friendly cities in Uttar Pradesh. Bike-friendly tracks have been established near the chief minister\\'s residence in the city. The four-and-a-half-kilometre (2.8 mi) track encompasses La-Martiniere College Road next to a golf club on Kalidas Marg, where the chief minister resides, and Vikramaditya Marg, which houses the office of the ruling party. The dedicated four-metre (13 ft) lane for cyclists is separate from the footpath and the main road. With Amsterdam as the inspiration, new cycle tracks are to be constructed in the city to make it more cycle-friendly, with facilities like bike rental also in the works.[141][142] In the year 2015, Lucknow also hosted a national level cycling event called \\'The Lucknow Cyclothon\\' in which professional and amateur cyclists took part.[143] An under-construction cycle track network by the government of Uttar Pradesh is set to make Lucknow the city with India\\'s biggest cycle network.[144]\\n\\nThe population of Lucknow Urban Agglomeration (LUA) rose above one million in 1981, while the 2001 census estimated it had risen to 2.24 million. This included about 60,000 people in the Lucknow Cantonment and 2.18 million in Lucknow city and represented an increase of 34.53% over the 1991 figure.[148]\\n\\nAccording to the provisional report of 2011 Census of India, Lucknow city had a population of 2,815,601, of which 1,470,133 were men and 1,345,468 women.[149][150] This was an increase of 25.36% compared to the 2001 figures.\\n\\nBetween 1991 and 2001, the population registered growth of 32.03%, significantly lower than the 37.14% which was registered between 1981 and 1991.[151] The initial provisional data suggests a population density of 1,815 inhabitants per square kilometre (4,700/sq mi) in 2011, compared to 1,443 in 2001.[151] As the total area covered by the Lucknow district is only about 2,528 square kilometres (976 sq mi), the population density was much than the 690 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,800/sq mi) recorded at the state level. The Scheduled Caste population of the state represented 21.3% of the total population, a figure higher than the state average of 21.15%.[152][153] Hindi is spoken by 88.16% of the population, while Urdu is spoken by 10.26%.[154]\\n\\nThe sex ratio in Lucknow city stood at 915 females per 1000 males in 2011, compared to the 2001 census figure of 888. The average national sex ratio in India is 940 according to the Census 2011 Directorate.[149] The city has a total literacy level in 2011 of 84.72% compared to 67.68% for Uttar Pradesh as a whole.[149] In 2001 these same figures stood at 75.98% and 56.27%. In Lucknow city, the total literate population totalled 2,147,564 people of which 1,161,250 were male and 986,314 were female.[149][155] Despite the fact that the overall work-participation rate in the district (32.24%) is higher than the state average (23.7%), the rate among females in Lucknow is very low at only 5.6% and shows a decline from the 1991 figure of 5.9%.[156][157]\\n\\nLucknow\\'s buildings show different styles of architecture with the many iconic buildings built during the British and Mughal era. More than half of these buildings lie in the old part of the city. The Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department organises a \"Heritage Walk\" for tourists covering the popular monuments.[158] Among the extant architecture, there are religious buildings such as Imambaras, mosques, and other Islamic shrines as well as secular structures such as enclosed gardens, baradaris, and palace complexes.[159]\\n\\nBara Imambara in Hussainabad is a colossal edifice built in 1784 by the then Nawab of Lucknow, Asaf-ud-Daula. It was originally built to provide assistance to people affected by the deadly famine, which struck the whole of Uttar Pradesh in the same year.[160] It is the largest hall in Asia without any external support from wood, iron or stone beams.[161] The monument required approximately 22,000 labourers during construction.[162]\\n\\nThe 18 m (60 feet) tall Rumi Darwaza, built by Nawab Asaf-ud-daula (r. 1775–1797) in 1784, served as the entrance to the city of Lucknow. It is also known as the Turkish Gateway, as it was erroneously thought to be identical to the gateway at Constantinople. The edifice provides the west entrance to the Great Imambara and is embellished with lavish decorations.[163]\\n\\nVarious architectural styles can be seen in the historical areas of Lucknow. The University of Lucknow shows a huge inspiration from the European style while Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture is prominently present in the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha building and Charbagh Railway station. Dilkusha Kothi is the remains of a palace constructed by the British resident Major Gore Ouseley around 1800 and showcases English Baroque architecture. It served as a hunting lodge for the Nawab of Awadhs and as a summer resort.[164]\\n\\nThe Chattar Manzil, which served as the palace for the rulers of Awadh and their wives is topped by an umbrella-like dome and so named on account of Chattar being the Hindi word for \"umbrella\". Opposite Chattar Manzil stands the \\'Lal Baradari\\' built by Nawab Saadat Ali Khan I between 1789 and 1814. It functioned as a throne room at coronations for the royal courts. The building is now used as a museum and contains delicately executed portraits of men who played major roles in the administration of the kingdom of Oudh.\\n\\nAnother example of mixed architectural styles is La Martiniere College, which shows a fusion of Indian and European ideas. It was built by Major-General Claude Martin who was born in Lyon and died in Lucknow on 13 September 1800. Originally named \"Constantia\", the ceilings of the building are domed with no wooden beams used for construction.[165] Glimpses of Gothic architecture can also be seen in the college building.[166]\\n\\nLucknow\\'s Asafi Imambara exhibits vaulted halls as its architectural speciality. The Bara Imambara, Chhota Imambara and Rumi Darwaza stand in testament to the city\\'s Nawabi mixture of Mughlai and Turkish styles of architecture while La Martiniere college bears witness to the Indo-European style. Even the new buildings are fashioned using characteristic domes and pillars, and at night these illuminated monuments become the city\\'s main attractions.[167]\\n\\nAround Hazratganj, the city\\'s central shopping area, there is a fusion of old and modern architecture. It has a multi-level parking lot in place of an old and dilapidated police station making way for extending the corridors into pebbled pathways, adorned with piazzas, green areas and wrought-iron and cast-iron lamp-posts, reminiscent of the Victorian era, flank both sides of the street.[168]\\n\\nIn common with other metropolitan cities across India, Lucknow is multicultural and multilingual.[169][170] Many of the cultural traits and customs peculiar to Lucknow have become living legends today. The city\\'s contemporary culture is the result of the amalgamation of the Hindu and Muslim rulers who ruled the city simultaneously. The credit for this goes to the secular and syncretic traditions of the Nawabs of Awadh, who took a keen interest in every walk of life and encouraged these traditions to attain a rare degree of sophistication. Modern-day Lucknowites are known for their polite and polished way of speaking which is noticed by visitors. The residents of Lucknow call themselves Lucknowites or Lakhnavi.[171] It also represents the melting pot of globalisation where the legacy of Nawab\\'s culture continues to be reflected in the traditional vocabulary of the Hindi language of the city along with better avenues for modernisation present here.[citation needed]\\n\\nLucknow is known for its ghararas. It is a traditional women\\'s outfit that originated from the Nawabs of Awadh.[172] It is a pair of loose trousers with pleats below the knee worn with a kurta (shirt) and a dupatta (veil). It is embroidered with zari and zardozi along with gota (decorative lace on the knee area). This dress is made from over 24 metres (26 yd) of fabric, mostly silk, brocade and kamkhwab.\\n\\nLanguage and poetry\\nAlthough Uttar Pradesh\\'s primary official language is Hindi, the most commonly spoken language is colloquial Hindustani.[173] Indian English is also well understood and is widely used for business and administrative purposes, as a result of India\\'s British heritage and Commonwealth tradition, as well as globalisation. The Urdu language is also a part of Lucknowi culture and heritage. It is mostly used by wealthier families, the remaining members of the royal family as well as in Urdu poetry and on public signs. The government has taken many innovative steps to promote Urdu.[174] Awadhi, a dialect of the Hindi dialect continuum, is the native dialect of Lucknow and has played an important role in Lucknow\\'s history and is still used in the city\\'s rural areas and by the urban population on the streets.[175]\\n\\nHistorically, Lucknow was considered one of the great centres of Muslim culture.[176][177] Two poets, Mir Babar Ali Anis and Mirza Dabeer, became legendary exponents of a unique genre of Muslim elegiacal poetry called marsiya centred on Imam Husain\\'s supreme sacrifice in the Battle of Karbala, which is commemorated during the annual observance of Muharram.[178]\\n\\nThe revolutionary Ram Prasad Bismil, who was hanged by the British at Gorakhpur jail, was largely influenced by the culture of Lucknow and remembered its name in his poetry.[179] Surrounding towns such as Kakori, Daryabad, Fatehpur, Barabanki, Rudauli, and Malihabad produced many eminent Urdu poets and litterateurs including Mohsin Kakorvi, Majaz, Khumar Barabankvi and Josh Malihabadi.[180]\\n\\nThe Awadh region has its own distinct Nawabi-style cuisine. Since ages, the Bawarchis (chefs) and Rakabdars (royal chefs) have developed great finesse in cooking and presentation of food, under royal patronage. This gave rise to the art of cooking over a slow fire (or Dum style cooking), which has become synonymous with \"Awadhi\" cuisine. These Bawarchis added elaborately prepared dishes like kababs, kormas, kaliya, nahari-kulchas, zarda, sheermal, roomali rotis and warqi parathas to the traditional \"Awadhi\" dastarkhwaan (feast of dishes).[181] The best-known dishes of this area consist of biryanis, kebabs and breads. Kebabs are served in a variety of styles; kakori, galawati, shami, boti, patili-ke, ghutwa and seekh are among the available varieties.[181] Tunde ke kabab restaurants are popular for a type of soft kebab developed by a one-armed chef (hence the name Tunday) for a Nawab who had lost his teeth.[182] The reputation of Lucknow\\'s kebabs is not limited to the local population and the dish attracts people from other cities as well as other countries.[183]\\n\\nLucknow is also known for its chaats, street food, kulfi, paan and sweets. Nahari, a dish prepared using mutton, is popular among non-vegetarians. Sheermal is a type of sweet bread (paratha) prepared in Lucknow. Makkhan-malai is another sweet delicacy of Lucknow made and sold only during winters. Some restaurants in the city are around a century old; there are also many high-end restaurants, bakeries, lounges and pubs which cater to the affluent class and foreign travellers.\\n\\nFestivals\\nIndian festivals such as Christmas, Diwali, Durga Puja, Eid, Holi, Raksha Bandhan and Vijayadashami are celebrated with great pomp and show in the city.[184] Some of the other festivals or processions are as follows:\\n\\nLucknow Mahotsav\\nLucknow Festival is organised every year to showcase Uttar Pradesh art and culture and to promote tourism.[185] With 1975–76 designated South Asian Tourism Year, Lucknow took the opportunity to promote the city\\'s art, culture and tourism to national and international tourists. The first Lucknow Festival was staged as a part of this promotion and ever since, with some exceptions, Lucknow Mahotsava has taken place annually.[186]\\n\\nLucknow Literature Festival\\nThis is an annual literature festival held in the month of November every year since 2013. Lucknow LitFest is India\\'s second-largest literature festival featuring some of the greatest writers and thinkers from across the globe.[187]\\n\\nMuharram\\nMain article: Azadari in Lucknow\\nLucknow is known as a seat of Shia Islam and the epitome of Shia culture in India. Muslims observe Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar and on Ashura (the tenth day of the month) mourn the memory of Imam Husain, grandson of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.[188] Muharram processions in Lucknow have a special significance and began during the reign of the Awadh Nawabs.\\nProcessions such as Shahi Zarih, Jaloos-e-Mehndi, Alam-e-Ashura and Chup Tazia had special significance by the Shia community and were affected with great religious zeal and fervour until 1977 the government of Uttar Pradesh banned public Azadari processions. For the following twenty years, processions and gatherings took place in private or community spaces including Talkatora Karbala, Bara Imambara (Imambara Asifi), Chota Imambara (Imambara Husainabad), Dargah Hazrat Abbas, Shah Najaf and Imambara Ghufran Ma\\'ab. The ban was partially lifted in 1997 and Shias were successful in taking out the first Azadari procession in January 1998 on the 21st of Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month. The Shias are authorised to stage nine processions out of the nine hundred that are listed in the register of the Shias.[189]\\n\\nDeva Mela is celebrated during the anniversary of Sufi saint Haji Waris Ali Shah at Dewa, India which is 26 K.M from Lucknow city. Sufi songs (Qawwalis) are recited at the Dargah. Devotees also carry sheets/Chadars to the shrines.\\n\\nChup Tazia\\nThe procession originated in Lucknow before spreading to other parts of South Asia. Dating back to the era of the Nawabs, it was started by Nawab Ahmed Ali Khan Shaukat Yar Jung a descendant of Bahu Begum. It has become one of the most important Azadari processions in Lucknow and one of the nine permitted by the government. This last mourning procession takes place on the morning of the 8th of Rabi\\' al-awwal, the third Muslim month and includes alam (flags), Zari and a ta\\'zieh (an imitation of the mausoleums in Karbala). It originates at the Imambara Nazim Saheb in Victoria Street then moves in complete silence through Patanala until it terminates at the Karbala Kazmain, where the colossal black ta\\'zieh is buried.[190]\\n\\nBada Mangal festival is celebrated in May as a birthday of the ancient Hanuman temple known as Purana Mandir. During this festival, fairs are conducted by the local public in the whole city. Bhandara is organised by local people almost in all streets across the city and serves free food to all the passersby irrespective of religion. Many of the Muslim Community also set up these Bhandara. It is celebrated in the name of Hindu God Lord Hanuman and reflects the Ganga Jamuni Tehzeeb.[190]\\n\\nThe classical Indian dance form Kathak originated from Lucknow.[191] Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, was a great patron and a passionate champion of Kathak. Lachhu Maharaj, Acchchan Maharaj, Shambhu Maharaj and Birju Maharaj have kept this tradition alive.[192][193]\\n\\nLucknow is also the home city of the eminent ghazal singer Begum Akhtar. A pioneer of the style, \"Ae Mohabbat Tere anjaam pe rona aaya\" is one of her best known musical renditions.[194] Bhatkande Music Institute University at Lucknow is named after the musician Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande[195] Bhartendu Academy of Dramatic Arts (BNA), also known as Bhartendu Natya Academy, is a theatre-training institute situated at Gomti Nagar. It is a deemed university and an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of Culture, Government of Uttar Pradesh. It was set up in 1975 by the Sangeet Natak Akademy (government of Uttar Pradesh), and became an independent drama school in 1977.[196] Apart from government institutes, there are many private theatre groups including IPTA, Theatre Arts Workshop (TAW), Darpan, Manchkriti and the largest youth theatre group, Josh. This is a group for young people to experience theatre activities, workshops and training.[197]\\n\\nLucknow is also the birthplace of musicians including Naushad, Talat Mahmood, Anup Jalota and Baba Sehgal as well as British pop celebrity Sir Cliff Richard.\\n\\nLucknow Chikan\\nLucknow is known for embroidery works including chikankari, zari, zardozi, kamdani and gota making (gold lace weaving).[198]\\n\\nChikankari is an embroidery work well known all over India. This 400-year-old art in its present form was developed in Lucknow and it remains the only location where the skill is practised today. Chikankari constitutes \\'shadow work\\' and is a delicate and artistic hand embroidery done using white thread on fine white cotton cloth such as fine muslin or chiffon. Yellowish muga silk is sometimes used in addition to the white thread. The work is done on caps, kurtas, saris, scarfs, and other vestments.[199] The chikan industry, almost unknown under the Nawabs, has not only survived but has flourished. About 2,500 entrepreneurs have engaged in manufacturing chikan for sale in local, national and international markets with Lucknow the largest exporter of chikan embroidered garments.[200]\\n\\nAs a sign of recognition, in December 2008, the Indian Geographical Indication Registry (GIR) accorded Geographical Indication (GI) status for chikankari, recognising Lucknow as the exclusive hub for its manufacture.[201]\\n\\nQuality of life\\nLucknow was ranked \"India\\'s second happiest city\" in a survey conducted by IMRB International and LG Corporation, after only Chandigarh. It fared better than other metropolitan cities in India including New Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai. Lucknow was found to be better than other cities in areas such as food, transit and overall citizen satisfaction.[202][203]\\n\\nEducation\\nSee also: List of educational institutions in Lucknow\\nLucknow is home to a number of prominent educational and research organisations including Indian Institute of Management Lucknow (IIM-L), Indian Institute of Information Technology, Lucknow (IIIT-L), Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI), Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET Lko), Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia National Law University (RMNLU), Institute of Hotel Management, Lucknow (IHM), Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI), Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences and King George\\'s Medical University (KGMU).[204] The National P.

Bara means big. An Imambara is a shrine built by Shia Muslims for the purpose of Azadari. This imambara is the second largest after the Nizamat Imambara.[citation needed]\\n\\nBuilding composition\\n\\nView from the roof of the labyrinth of Bara Imambara\\nThe building complex also includes the large Asfi mosque, the Bhul-bhulaiya (the labyrinth), and Bowli, a steep well with running water. Two imposing gateways lead to the main hall. It is said that there are 1024 ways to reach the terrace, but only two ways to come back, which is through the first gate or the last gate. It is an accidental architecture.[citation needed]\\n\\nRelief measure\\nConstruction of Bara Imambara was started in 1780, a year of devastating famine, and one of Asaf-ud-Daula\\'s objectives in embarking on this grandiose project was to provide employment for people in the region for almost a decade while the famine lasted. It is said that ordinary people used to work during the day building up the edifice, while noblemen and other elite worked at night to break down anything that was raised that day. It was a project that preceded a Keynesian-like intervention for employment generation. Construction of the Imambara was completed in 1784. The estimated cost of building the Imambara ranges between half a million rupees to a million rupees. Even after completion, the Nawab used to spend between four and five hundred thousand rupees on its decoration annually.[1]\\n\\nThe architecture of the complex reflects the maturation of ornamented Mughal design, namely the Badshahi Mosque; it is one of the last major projects not incorporating any European elements or the use of iron. The main imambara consists of a large vaulted central chamber containing the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. At 50 by 16 meters and over 15 meters tall, it has no beams supporting the ceiling and is one of the largest such arched constructions in the world. There are eight surrounding chambers built to different roof heights, permitting the space above these to be reconstructed as a three-dimensional labyrinth with passages interconnecting with each other through 489 identical doorways. This part of the building, and often the whole complex, may be referred to as the Bhulbhulaiya. It is a popular attraction among the locals as well as the tourists and is possibly the only existing maze in India. It came about unintentionally to support the weight of the building, which is constructed on marshy land. Asaf-ud-Daula also erected the 18 meter (59 foot) high Roomi Darwaza just outside. This portal, embellished with lavish decorations, was the Imambara\\'s west-facing entrance. The Bara Imambara is among the grandest buildings of Lucknow.[2]\\n\\nThe design of the Imambara was acquired through a competitive process. The winner was a Delhi architect Kifayatullah,[1] who also lies buried in the main hall of the Imambara. It is another unique aspect of the building that the sponsor and the architect lie buried beside each other.\\n\\nChota Imambara, also known as Imambara Hussainabad Mubarak is an imposing monument located in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. It took 54 years to finalize it. Built as an imambara or a congregation hall for Shia Muslims, by Muhammad Ali Shah, the Nawab of Awadh in 1838,[1] it was to serve as a mausoleum for himself and his mother, who is buried beside him.[2]\\n\\nThe significance of Panjetan, the holy five, is once again emphasized here with five main doorways. This Imambara consists of two halls and a Shehnasheen (a platform where the Zarih of Imam Husain is kept.) Zarih is the replica of that protective grill or structure which is kept on the grave of Imam Husain at Karbala, Iraq. The large green and white bordered hall of Azakhana is richly decorated with chandeliers and a good number of crystal glass lamp-stands. In fact, it was for this profuse decoration that the Imambara was referred by European visitors and writers as The Palace of Lights. The exterior is very beautifully decorated with Quranic verses in Islamic calligraphy .\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nNaubat Khana or ceremonial gateway at Chhota Imambara.\\nThe Chhota Imambara stands to the west of Bara Imambara and an imposing gateway known as Rumi Darwaza.[2] The building is also known as the Palace of Lights because of its decorations and chandeliers during special festivals, like Muharram.[3]\\n\\nThe chandeliers used to decorate the interior of this building were brought from Belgium.[4] Also housed within the building, is the crown of Muhammad Ali Shah and ceremonial tazias.[2] Thousands of labourers worked on the project to gain famine relief.\\n\\nIt has a gilded dome and several turrets and minarets. The tombs of Muhammad Ali Shah and other members of his family are inside the imambara. This includes two replicas of the Taj Mahal, built as the tombs of Muhammad Ali Shah\\'s daughter and her husband. The walls are decorated with Arabic calligraphy.[2]\\n\\nWater supply for the fountains and the water bodies inside the imambara came directly from the Gomti River.[5]\\n\\nTomb of Princess Asiya Begum, daughter of Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah Bahadur (3rd Nawab of Awadh)\\nThis structure serves as a mausoleum for the grave of Princess Asiya Begum Sahiba, daughter of the Nawab Mohammed Ali Shah and two other graves. This is a small-scale copy of the Taj Mahal.\\n\\nTreasury\\nThe other structure facing the tomb was built for the architectural symmetry and balance of the Imambara. It was used as a treasury.\\n\\nHusainabad Mosque\\nThis mosque is built on a high platform with two grand minarets on the edge of the platform. This mosque is very beautifully decorated with floral designs and Quranic calligraphy.\\n\\nSatkhanda\\n\\nSatkhanda, the incomplete watch tower and lunar observatory\\nThe word Satkhanda means seven-storeyed but this beautifully proportioned tower would never live up to its name as construction was halted at level 4. Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah commissioned the structure during his reign, which started in 1837 and went on till 1842. He built it as a watch-tower to provide a bird’s eye view of the old city area of Lucknow. The tower has many huge triple-arched windows and compartments. A flight of spiral steps leads to different storeys of the building.[6]\\n\\nImproper restoration\\nThe building has been renovated; however, the process has been criticized. In 2016 The Economist wrote that \"[this building] was recently “repaired” with modern cement, wrecking its subtle plasterwork\".[7]\\n\\nImambara Ghufran Ma\\'ab (Urdu: اِمام باڑا غُفران مآب, Hindi: इमामबाड़ा ग़ुफ़्रान मआब) in Lucknow, India is an imambara (a building used to commemorate the Muharram commemoration period in which Muslims, particularly Shias mourning the tragedy of Karbala in which Imam Hussain was killed) constructed by Shia cleric Ayatollah Syed Dildar Ali Naseerabadi Al Jayasi (also known as Ghufran-Ma\\'ab) in the early 1790s.[1]\\n\\nThe imambara\\nThe imambara is named Ghufran Ma\\'ab after popular name of Ayatollah Syed Dildar Ali \\'Gufran Ma\\'ab\\' and is major religious culture center of Lucknow.[1][2] It is run by his descendants of Ayatollah Ghufran Ma\\'ab, as of May 2012 his descendant, Maulana Syed Kalbe Jawad is mutawalli of the imambara.[2][3] The imambara is located at Maulana Kalbe Hussain Road in Chowk locality of Lucknow.[2]\\n\\nKalbe Jawad addresses the majlis (gathering) there for the first 10 days of the holy month of Muharram which is attended by thousands of people.[2][4] The imambara is known internationally for its Shaam-e-Ghariban majlis.[5]\\n\\nThe graveyard\\nOutside the Imambara is a graveyard (part of the Imambara) which was intended to be used as a place of burial for scholars. Many eminent personalities are buried in its graveyard.[1] People buried in its graveyard include Saheb e Abaqat Syed Hamid Husain, Maulana Syed Kalbe Hussain, Maulana Syed Kalbe Abid, Maulana Syed Ibne Hasan Nonaharvi and Sultan-ul-Ulema Maulana Syed Qaim Mahdi, Maulana Syed Mohammad Waris Hasan Naqvi, Maulana Syed Kalbe Sadiq.\\n\\nThere is an Imambarah with same name (i.e. Imambara Ghufran Ma\\'ab) in Nasirabad the ancestral village Ayatollah Syed Dildar Ali Naseerabadi.\\n\\nAmina Hamza Bazaar is one of the oldest market centers in the city of Lucknow along with Chowk, Nathan\\'s and Hazratganj. Its traders and shops are involved in both wholesale and retail commerce. The main commodities and goods traded are clothes, Chikan embroidery work, spices, dry snacks, hosieries and wedding decorations. In fact, Aminabad is a combination of various markets, cluster of houses, offices and is often compared to the bustling Chandni Chowk of Delhi.\\n\\nIt still has his importance in the Lucknow market and is still the pillar of lucknow markets. Aminabad is known for the efforts of Vedanta Singh.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe year the marketplace came into being is not clear. But by all accounts, it was during the rule of the Nawab that the market got its present basic form and name.\\n\\nAccording to the most credible version of history, the land on which Aminabad stands belonged to Rani Jai Kunwar Pandey. The Rani, besides being a vassal of the Mughals, was also a great associate of Khadija Khanam\\'s, the Begum (wife) of the first Nawab of Awadh, Saadat Khan Burhan-ul-Mulk, who was also the Grand-Wazir of the Mughal Empire.[1]\\n\\nThe Rani constructed a Mosque on the mentioned land of Aminabad, and gifted it to her good ally, the wife of the Nawab. This 18th-century Mosque, known as Padain Ki Masjid (The Brahmin Woman\\'s Mosque), still currently stands in Aminabad to this day. The Maqbara of Begum Khadija Khanam was also constructed in front of the masjid, but since has been lost to the vagaries of time, though the grave is still merely visible.[1]\\n\\nBy the time the Nawabs moved their court from Faizabad to Lucknow, the site had become the center of activity and irregular commerce. It was a part of the city known as Masarratganj. The actual land on which Aminabad later was built on had passed under the possession of Sikandar Shikoh, a son of the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II. After the death of Sikandar Shikoh his wife became custodian of the property in Masarratganj and she sold it for Rs.2800/- to Nawab Imdad Husain Khan Aminuddaulah, who was the Prime Minister of Nawab Amjad Ali Shah, the fourth Nawab of Lucknow. This was around the 1840s.\\n\\nAminuddaulah was a visionary, who took upon the task of metamorphosing the area into a developed zone. Over the following years, concrete houses, shops and parks replaced the thatched huts and ramshackle shelters in the open fields. Traders, craftsmen and entertainers were encouraged to set up their establishments there. Four gates had been erected on all four sides, and each gate had an adjoining mosque. The biggest gate, known as \"Kalaan Phatak\" was at the main crossing. The mosque near it was also called \"Kalaan Phatak Masjid\". Towards the west was the smaller Khurd Gate near Mehra Cinema on Gwynne Road. The gates no longer exist, but the mosques are still intact and are known by their original names. Aminuddaulah also initiated the construction of a big park in the area within the rows of the newly opened shops during this timespan.\\n\\nAfter the revolt of 1857, the rule of the Nawabs came to an end and the Aminabad came under British rule. After the mutiny of 1857, the entire area came under the rule of the British. Later in 1905, Lt. Governor Sir Sir James Latouche, visited Aminabad and ordered its renovation. It was then that Latouche Road leading to this market came into existence and to date is called so. The renovated Aminabad was inaugurated by Sir Latouche himself in 1911.[2]\\n\\nMeanwhile, Babu Ganga Prasad Varma came to live in Aminabad in 1910 and designed the market with big corridors, so that roads could be used for walking. Ganga Prasad Memorial Hall was built by him for public functions. He was the one who came up with the idea of constructing Goonge Nawab Park.[3]\\n\\nIn 1912 the British government made a master plan for this area and, as per the plan, roads on all four sides of this park were laid out and the park came to be known as Aminuddaulah Park. In the following years, the importance and stature of Chowk and Nakhas bazaar started receding and Aminabad gained ascendancy, and Aminuddaulah Park became not only the talk of the town but the nation itself. In 1928 it was at this park where during the struggle for independence the freedom fighters first hoisted the tri-colour. That eventful day was followed by the address to the nation by Mahatma Gandhi for the civil disobedience movement. Many more leaders including Jawahar Lal Nehru, Atal Bihari Bajpayee and Subhash Chandra Bose gave fiery speeches for independence at this platform.\\n\\nThe huge congregation that had gathered at Aminuddaulah Park to listen to Jawahar Lal Nehru was brutally lathi-charged by the British force and several people, including Nehru, got hurt. Gulab Singh Lodhi had climbed up a tree in the park and hoisted the tri-colour flag. The British police shot him down and later on his statue was installed in the centre of the park and still stands there. The park by now had acquired the name of Jhandewala Park because flags of various Indian political parties fluttered here. Prior to independence, the literati of the city had made Aminabad their place of dwelling and they eagerly awaited the leading Indian newspapers like Humdum, Haqeeqat and Pioneer each morning. Newspaper vendors would come to the main crossing early morning and their wares were sold until late evening. The writers, poets and educationists even then frequented Danish Mahal in the ground floor of Central Hotel, and the nearby Siddiq Book Depot and Anwar Book Depot. There was a time when at these erudite centres one could have come across the likes of Syed Masood Hasan Rizvi, Dr. Shujaat Ali Sandilavi, Josh Malihabadi, Prof. Ehtesham Husain, Nawab Mirza Jafar Ali Khan ‘Asar’, Majaz and many more. The owner of Danish Mahal, Nasim Ahmad, who died recently, was not only well-conversant with all kinds of books, but was also familiar with the persona and wherewithal of the stalwarts of the town.[4]\\n\\nSince the time of Nawabs, the market boasts of its unmatched fashion, and being one of the oldest markets, it is still surrounded by buildings and architectures of nawabi era.\\n\\nShops\\nShops sell fashion products, interior decoration, bed sheets bed Covers, carpets, ornaments, jewelry, fashion garments, fancy dresses, chikan kurta, chikan sarees and other women\\'s wear, chikan menswear, footwear and other such apparel. Most products are locally produced. A special attraction is Thursday\\'s footpath market.\\n\\nAmong the less wide streets of the nawabi times, the market shows off a wide variety of products on sale. In spite of being congested at times, Aminabad is a colorful, vibrant and lively market to shop, with products ranging from gold and silver to jewelry and ornaments, chikan kurtas to fancy sarees loaded with embroidery, from Lucknawi paan (betel leaves) to bakeries.\\n\\nEateries include non-vegetarian restaurants, sweet shops, bakeries and paan shops, including Tunday Kababi, Wahid Biryani and Alamgir, Kalika Chat House\\n\\nSome of the oldest shops are Om Prakash Seth, Madan Sarees, Dupatta Mahal, Sargodha Cloth House, Sri Keshav Handloom, Keshav Decor. Aminabad has been a business center for traders, merchants, craftsmen and artists since the 18th century.\\n\\n\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"
